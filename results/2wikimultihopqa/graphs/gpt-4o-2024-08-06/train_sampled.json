            "Gerhard Lamprecht (6 October 1897 \u2013 4 May 1974) was a German film director, screenwriter and film historian. He directed 63 films between 1920 and 1958. He also wrote for 26 films between 1918 and 1958.",
            "Louis Marie Malle( 30 October 1932 \u2013 23 November 1995) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. His film\" Le Monde du silence\" won the Palme d' Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony; the award was instead presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of only four directors to have won the Golden Lion twice. Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film\" Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud\"( 1958), the World War II drama\" Lacombe, Lucien\"( 1974), the romantic crime film\" Atlantic City\"( 1980), the comedy- drama\" My Dinner with Andre\"( 1981), and the autobiographical film\" Au revoir les enfants\"( 1987).",
            "L' Inde fant\u00f4me: Reflexions sur un voyage is a 1969 French seven part television documentary miniseries about India, directed by Louis Malle. It was shown on BBC television as Phantom India. Malle later said that the film was his most personal work and the one he was most proud of, it is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his career. It was initially inspired by a two- month trip to India in late 1967 that Malle made on behalf of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to present a selection of\" new French cinema\" throughout the country. Filming took place between January 5, 1968, and May 1, 1968, with a crew of two, a cameraman and a sound recordist. Malle arrived in India with no particular plans and financed the trip himself. The resulting 30 hours of footage was then edited down to the 363 minutes of\" Phantom India\". The 105- minute- long\" Calcutta\" used the footage he had recorded over his three- week stay in that city. \" Phantom India\" was shown on French television and the BBC in the UK in 1969. Many British Indians and the Indian Government felt that Malle had shown a one- sided portrait of India, focussing on the impoverished, rather than the developing, parts of the country. A diplomatic incident occurred when the Indian government asked the BBC to stop broadcasting the programme. The BBC refused and were briefly asked to leave their New Delhi bureau."

He spent twenty-three years in exile, from 1791 to 1814, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, and again in 1815, during the period of the Hundred Days, upon the return of Napoleon I from Elba. Until his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence succeeded as (titular) king Louis XVIII. Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, England, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored his French Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne. Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while still reigning, as Charles X (1824\u20131830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830\u20131848) and Napoleon III (1852\u20131870) were deposed.",

In 1952, she was elevated to the office of Hand of the Cause of God, for which she attended to issues related to the expansion and protection of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and served an important role in the transfer of authority from 1957 to 1963. R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed was raised in Montreal, Quebec. After two trips to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed holy land in Haifa, Israel, she engaged in many youth activities in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. She married Shoghi Effendi in 1937.

In 2004, CBC viewers voted her number 44 on the list of \"greatest Canadians\" on the television show \"The Greatest Canadian\".

A prolific writer since her youth, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was the author of several published books, such as \"Prescription for Living\" and \"The Priceless Pearl\".

Shoghi Effendi spent his early life in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre). His education was directed to serving as secretary and translator to his grandfather, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then leader of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and son of the religion's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. After the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, the leadership of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the \"Guardian\", and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had been declared Covenant-breakers by either \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without appointing a successor Guardian, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith."

Traub was the author or editor of ten monographs and some 120 papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, finance, and economics. In 1959 he began his work on optimal iteration theory culminating in his 1964 monograph, which is still in print. Subsequently he pioneered work with Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski on computational complexity applied to continuous scientific problems (information-based complexity). He collaborated in creating significant new algorithms including the Jenkins-Traub Algorithm for Polynomial Zeros, as well as the Kung-Traub, Shaw-Traub, and Brent-Traub algorithms. One of his research areas was continuous quantum computing. As of November 10, 2015, his works have been cited 8500 times, and he has an h-index of 35. From 1971 to 1979 he headed the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon and led it from a critical period to eminence (see Joseph Traub digital archive at Carnegie Mellon). From 1979 to 1989 he was the founding Chair of the Computer Science Department at Columbia. From 1986 to 1992 he served as founding Chair of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Academies and held the post again 2005\u20132009.

            "Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150million records worldwide. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \" Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, \"September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy-winning television special . After releasing \"Sinatra at the Sands\", recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\". It was followed by 1968's \"Francis A. & Edward K.\" with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for \"From Here to Eternity\", he starred in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"High Society\" (1956), and \"Pal Joey\" (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in \"Tony Rome\" (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. In crime, Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation After Sinatra's death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.",
            "\"Witchcraft\" is a popular song from 1957 composed by Cy Coleman with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh. It was released as a single by Frank Sinatra, and reached number six in the U.S., spending sixteen weeks on the charts. Elvis Presley sang this song in ."

His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" sold for \u00a3181,250 at Sotheby's in 2008, a record for the artist. William Somerville Shanks was born in Gourock in Renfrewshire in 1864 to Helen and John Shanks (1923-1913), a horse proprietor who worked as a clothier and tailor in his native town of Paisley where generations of his family had been weavers. According to the 1871 census they were living at 1, George Place in Gourock with their four children: Mary, William, Agnes and Archibald. The 1881 census reveals that by then the family were living in Glasgow where William Somerville Shanks was working as a pattern designer for a curtain manufacturer. However, William Shanks had ambitions to be an artist, and after attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art under Francis Henry Newbery he made painting his career, in 1889 travelling to Paris to improve his skills, studying for three years at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. In Paris Shanks became influenced by the paintings of Edouard Manet. His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1897 and at one time was owned by Eliot Hodgkin who sold it to art dealer Charlotte Frank, the aunt of Anne Frank; Sir David Montagu Douglas Scott obtained it from her in 1962 for \u00a360. On loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 2007 to 2008, it sold at Sotheby's in 2008 for \u00a3181,250, a record for the artist. Shanks was to become a regular exhibitor at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy. Later Shanks was to return to the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) as a tutor of painting and drawing, remaining there for the next 29 years. A painter in oil and watercolours of portraits, interiors and still life but who preferred to work in oils, at the GSA Shanks was Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Antique and preparatory life 1910 to 1911; Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Life, head life, portrait and costume model, painting, antique and still life 1913 to 1914 and 1924 to 1925; Lecturer (Drawing and Painting) Drawing, painting and composition 1925 to 1926 and 1929 to 1930; Drawing and Painting (School of Design, Pictorial and Commercial Art) 1930 to 1931; Drawing and Painting (Drawing and Painting) 1934 to 1935. In 1922 he received a silver medal at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. Although not a member of the Glasgow Boys Shanks was clearly influenced by their work and would have known Edward Atkinson Hornel and George Henry. Shanks was elected an Associate (ARSA) of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1923 and elected Member of the RSA in 1933. Shanks lived at 8 Parkgrove Terrace in Glasgow. A self portrait (see above) is held in the Collection of National Galleries of Scotland."

            "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\". John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over \u00a3300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a \"melodic genius\" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.",

            "Abisin Abbas (26 February 1902 \u2013 20 October 1961), better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara , was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies. Born in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, he first worked as a reporter in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play \"Dr Samsi\". After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, \"Noesa Penida\" (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.",
            "Gadis Desa (literally \"Maiden from the Village\") is a 1949 comedy from what is now Indonesia written and directed by Andjar Asmara. Starring Basuki Djaelani, Ratna Ruthinah, Ali Joego, and Djauhari Effendi, it follows the romantic hijinks of a village girl who is taken to be a rich man's second wife. The film, produced by a Dutch-run company, is recognised as the first in which future \"father of Indonesian film\" Usmar Ismail was involved."

The film is noted for starring Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite Z Special Unit against the Empire of Japan during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit.

A key figure in Australian postwar cinema , Burstall was instrumental in rebuilding the Australian film industry at a time when it had been effectively dead for over a decade. He created groundbreaking Australian films including \"StorkEnd PlayEliza FraserThe Last of the Knucklemen\" and the 1987 adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel \"Kangaroo\". Burstall's films featured early appearances by many legendary Australian actors including Jack Thompson, Bruce Spence, Jacki Weaver, \"Alvin\" star Graeme Blundell, John Waters and Judy Davis. Burstall's wife, Betty Burstall, an important figure in her own right, founded the pioneering La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in the late 1960s, with which Tim was involved. Speaking just after Burstall's death, David Williamson said that Burstall \"couldn't stomach\" Australia's lack of a film industry. \" He was determined to do something about it and he had the energy and spirit to do it. (He) was a very important cultural figure: highly intelligent, widely read, with a succinct and often highly controversial opinion on everything.\""

            "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 \u2013 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized. He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\"."

In the mid-to-late 1960s, Findlay was prominent among a small group of underground New York filmmakers (including Joseph W. Sarno, Joseph P. Mawra, and Lou Campa) that produced exploitation \"roughies\" (early slasher films which combined conventional horror or thriller stories with sadomasochistic sex scenes) for the grindhouse market. Sometimes he would direct under the alias Julian Marsh and act in his own films billed as Robert West. His wife Roberta (a.k.a. Anna Riva) was the cinematographer, co-writer, and supporting actress for many of their films together. They also employed the same actors repeatedly, most notably Uta Erickson, and Marie Brent, a.k.a. Janet Banzet. The Findlays were friends with George Weiss, producer of Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda\" and a series of fetishistic \"Olga\" films (\"Olga's House of ShameOlga's Girls\", et al.) .

He helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, earning him the nicknames \"Prince of Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\". Gaye's Motown hits include \"Ain't That PeculiarHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", and duet recordings with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Diana Ross, and Tammi Terrell. During the 1970s, he recorded the albums \" What's Going On\" and \"Let's Get It On\" and became one of the first artists in Motown, along with Stevie Wonder, to break away from the reins of a production company. His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. Following a period in Europe as a tax exile in the early 1980s, he released the 1982 hit \"Sexual Healing\", which won him his first two Grammy Awards, and its parent album \"Midnight Love\". Gaye's last television appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and on \"Soul Train\" which was his third and final appearance. On April 1, 1984, the day before his 45th birthday, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards and other honors including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

            "Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 \u2013 October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Many of his songs became standards noted for their witty, urbane lyrics, and many of his scores found success on Broadway and in film. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, Porter defied his grandfather's wishes and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn to musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike many successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote the lyrics as well as the music for his songs. After a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work. His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and '30s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, \"Kiss Me, Kate\". It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter's other musicals include \"Fifty Million FrenchmenDuBarry Was a LadyAnything GoesCan -Can\" and \"Silk Stockings\". His numerous hit songs include \"Night and DayBegin the BeguineI Get a Kick Out of YouWell , Did You Evah!I've Got You Under My SkinMy Heart Belongs to Daddy\" and \"You're the Top\". He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including \"Born to Dance\" (1936), which featured the song \" You'd Be So Easy to LoveRosalie\" (1937), which featured \"In the Still of the NightHigh Society\" (1956), which included \"True Love\"; and \"Les Girls\" (1957)."

Born in Danzig, she was the daughter of Werner Lorenz, who would later become an SS member and head of the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle in Nazi Germany. She first rode a horse at the age of two, sitting on her father's lap, and took up equestrianism at a young age. Her career was interrupted by World War II, however, and she served as a nurse during the conflict. She did not resume riding until 1950 but, soon after, her talents were spotted at a Berlin horse show. Among other international appearances, she participated in the individual dressage event at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where she finished seventh in a field of seventeen competitors. She retired from active competition in the late 1970s, having been the German national champion in women's dressage seven times. Following her competitive career, Springer took up judging and training, the latter of which occupied her time until at least 2012. In her late 80s she continued to ski twice a year and occasionally ride in informal tournaments in Germany. She married cement manufacturer Horst-Herbert Alsen in 1941 and divorced him in 1953 to marry Alsen's friend, journalist Axel Springer. This union lasted until 1961 when Springer left her to marry Helga Ludewig. On her 75th birthday, Springer was honored by the German Equestrian Federation (FN) for her contributions to the sport.

Although the song may be a reference to taking a direction and suddenly not knowing where to go, it is in fact about the friendship between Oblio and the dog. It is also a parable for discrimination.",
            "Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 \u2013 January 15, 1994), known mononymously as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who achieved the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a 3\u00bd octave range , Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours. The craft of his songs and the defiant attitude he projected remains a touchstone for later generations of indie rock musicians. Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family's poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing, and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP \"Pandemonium Shadow Show\", followed by a variety of releases that include a collaboration with Randy Newman (\"Nilsson Sings Newman\", 1970) and the original children's story \"The Point!\" (1971). His most commercially successful album, \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" (1971), produced the international top 10 singles \"Without You\" and \"Coconut\". His other top 10 hit, \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1968), was a prominent song in the 1969 film \"Midnight Cowboy\". A version of Nilsson's \"One\", released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.\nDuring a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered \"Nilsson\". He soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. In the 1970s, Nilsson and Lennon joined Starr as members of the Hollywood Vampires drinking club, embroiling themselves in a number of widely publicized, alcohol-fueled incidents. At the same time, they produced one collaborative album, \"Pussy Cats\" (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon's 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. Nilsson created the first remix album (\"Aerial Pandemonium Ballet\", 1971) and recorded the first mashup song (\"You Can't Do That\", 1967). He was voted No. 62 in \"Rolling Stone\"s 2015 list of the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\", where he was described as \"a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound, a crucial bridge between the baroque psychedelic pop of the late Sixties and the more personal singer-songwriter era of the Seventies\". The RIAA certified \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" and \"Son of Schmilsson\" as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. His honors include Grammy Awards for two of his recordings; Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male in 1970 for \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male in 1973 for \"Without You\". In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, \"Losst and Founnd\" (2019)."

As a director, Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low- budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant- garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio- system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939's\" Hotel Imperial\". He directed more than 50 movies. His most popular film is likely the first Marx Brothers feature\" The Cocoanuts\" of 1929, and his 1932 foray into Universal- style horror,\" Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film\" Daughter of Shanghai\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called\" widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films\".",

(Antakaa Meille Luurankomme in Finnish, Oaivveskaldjut in North Sami) is a 1999 documentary film directed by Paul-Anders Simma about Niillas Somby, a Sami man who retraces his family ancestry as he searches for the head of his ancestor, Mons Somby. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jakobsen H\u00e6tta were executed by decapitation on 14 October 1854 for murder, following the 1852 Kautokeino rebellion against the local Norwegian government in which two people were murdered. Their heads were claimed by the government for scientific research, and were held as part of a collection of 900 skulls at the Anatomical Institute, in Oslo. The movie describes three parallel plots; the first is Niillas Somby's story on how he became one of the most celebrated protesters during the Alta Dam Protests between 1979-1981 near Kautokeino, Norway. In the years that followed, he traveled in exile to Canada where he was given sanctuary by the Iroquois First Nation, and later returned to Norway. The second plot was the disturbing examination of the scientific racism and racial classification movement that was considered an accepted fact by Scandinavian scientists from the early 19th century until the 1950s. This included the plundering of Sami graves for their skeletons and the forced sterilization of the Sami and other peoples in Scandinavia who were viewed as competing with the \"noble races\", as part of a larger eugenics program. The third and final plot was Niillas Somby's emotional struggle with bringing Mons Somby's skull home for a proper burial.",

            "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri( 15 October 1917 \u2013 23 August 1994) was a Hungarian film director and screenwriter. His films\" The Boys of Paul Street\"( 1969) and\" Hungarians\"( 1978) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His 1965 film\" Twenty Hours\" shared the Grand Prix with\" War and Peace\" at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1969 film\" The Toth Family\" was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1975 film\" 141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence\" was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, where he won a Special Prize for Directing. F\u00e1bri wanted to become an artist from an early age on. He studied painting and graduated at the Hungarian College of Fine Arts. He began working in the Hungarian film industry in 1950 as a production designer. He directed his first film\" ViharStorm\") in 1951. He became an internationally acclaimed director with his third feature\" K\u00f6rhintaMerry Go- Round\") in 1956. He continued directing and writing until the early 1980s. After his retirement from the film industry F\u00e1bri taught on the Hungarian University of Theatrical and Film Arts. In his last years he wrote screenplays; they were never made. F\u00e1bri was also the president of the Hungarian Film Artist Union from 1959 to 1981. F\u00e1bri's style of filmmaking can be described mainly as\" classical\", using academic techniques of art filmmaking. His greatest influences were the Italian Neorealism and French Poetic Realism. He experimented with narrative and flashback techniques for a while in the 1960s( in his films\" Nappali s\u00f6t\u00e9ts\u00e9g\" and\" H\u00fasz \u00f3ra\") and his 1976 film\" Az \u00f6t\u00f6dik pecs\u00e9t\" contains some highly surrealist scenes, but overall he never used the mannerisms of modernist film in his works. For this reason the K\u00e1d\u00e1r regime favored F\u00e1bri over more controversial and experimental directors like Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3. The film won the Golden Prize at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. He was known as a perfectionist who wrote, drawn and choreographed every scene to the most precise detail months before production began and never improvised anything. His reputation as a rigid, tyrannical director was somewhat contradicted by his friendly and kind behaviour towards the British and American child actors on the set of\" The Boys of Paul Street\". F\u00e1bri made nearly all of his films based on literary material( novels or short stories) and wrote the screenplays himself. His constant theme was the question of humanity. Many of his films are set in or around World War II. Two of his frequent collaborators were actress Mari T\u00f6r\u0151csik and cinematographer Gy\u00f6rgy Ill\u00e9s. In 1969 he played the role of prosecuted statesman Zolt\u00e1n D\u00e1niel in his friend P\u00e9ter Bacs\u00f3's cult satire,\" A tan \u00fa The Witness\") as his sole acting job. F\u00e1bri died in a heart attack at the age of 76 in 1994. His legal successor is Peter Fabri( b. 1985).",

He also directed dramas and romantic subjects, such as\" Love Story\"( 1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars. Hiller collaborated on films with screenwriters Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon. Among his other films were\" The Americanization of Emily\"( 1964),\" Tobruk\"( 1967),\" The Hospital\"( 1971),\" The Out- of- Towners\"( 1970),\" Plaza Suite\"( 1971),\" The Man in the Glass Booth\"( 1975),\" Silver Streak\"( 1976),\" The In- Laws\"( 1979) and\" Outrageous Fortune\"( 1987).

The film was produced by Bryan Foy who was head of Warners B picture unit until 1942. It was also a radio show starring Dana Andrews with 78 episodes that ran from April 23, 1952 until October 14, 1953. The film was based on a series of stories written by Matt Cvetic that appeared in\" The Saturday Evening Post\". The stories were later turned into a best- selling book and radio series. The story follows Cvetic, who infiltrated a local Communist Party cell for nine years and reported back to the Federal Bureau of Investigation( FBI) on their activities. The film and radio show are, in part, artifacts of the McCarthy era, as well as a time capsule of American society during the Second Red Scare. The purpose of both is partly to warn people about the threat of Communist subversion of American society. The tone of the show is ultra-patriotic, with Communists portrayed as racist, vindictive, and tools of a totalitarian foreign power, the Soviet Union.",

It was produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti and features lead guitar by Robert Fripp. Like the album as a whole, the song demonstrates the influence of German Krautrock. The track is in part a tribute to performance artist Chris Burden, who was famous for having himself nailed to a Volkswagen in 1974 (\"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are\") and for having an assistant shoot him in the arm at an art gallery in 1971 (\"Guess you'll buy a gun / You'll buy it secondhandJoe the Lion\" has also been seen as reflecting Bowie's struggle to overcome the emotional numbness that appeared to permeate his previous album \"LowYou get up and sleep\"). Bowie played the song live on the 1983 Serious Moonlight and 1995 Outside tours, and it was considered (but ultimately not performed) for his 1987 Glass Spider Tour. \"Joe the Lion\" has been described by critic Chris O'Leary as \"phenomenal\" and \"one of the high peaks of Bowie's late Seventies\".",

In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album \" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \" The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\" (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\"Heroes (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with \"The Next Day.\" He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, \"Blackstar\" (2016)."

            "Steven Andrew Soderbergh( born January 14, 1963) is an American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and actor. He is an early pioneer of independent cinema. Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough\u2014indie drama\" Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"( 1989) \u2014lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d' Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy\" Out of Sight\"( 1998); biopic\" Erin Brockovich\"( 2000) and crime drama film\" Traffic\"( 2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the\" Ocean's\" trilogy and film franchise( 2001 \u2013 18);\" Contagion\"( 2011);\" Magic Mike\"( 2012);\" Side Effects\"( 2013);\" Logan Lucky\"( 2017); and\" Unsane\"( 2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$ 2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant- garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard."

Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to consider him the \"American Dream personified.\" Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939); Capra was nominated as Best Director and as producer for Academy Award for Best Picture on all three films, winning both awards on the first two. During World War II, Capra served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and produced propaganda films, such as the \"Why We Fight\" series. After World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. In ensuing decades, however, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry, engaging in various political and social activities. He served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the Directors Guild of America."

He taught the violoncello as well, and cellist Elvira Paoli was one of his students. While teaching violoncello, Bellenghi\" became enamored of the mandolin,\" which was in fashion at the time with the aristocracy and nobility in Italy. He worked to spread its popularity further. He began to perform in concerts as a mandolinist between 1880 and 1900. Bellenghi organized concerts in Florence and Bologna, where\" celebrated mandolinists, Riccardo Rovinazzi, Giuseppe Silvestri, and Caroline Grimaldi took part.\" He was also one of three teachers to be given the privilege of teaching the mandolin to Princess Margherita of the Royal family of Italy; Belisario Mattera and Constantino Bertucci also received that honor. He began to write for the mandolin, creating\" light selections.\" He first published with Ricordi in Milan, but later founded Forlivesi& Company Publishing in Florence, which was a major music publisher when he died in 1902, publishing more than 7000 musical compositions. Bellenghi's own compositions were very numerous, and he published many lighter works under the name of G. B. Pirani. He wrote the comprehensive\" Method for the mandolin in three parts\", which is published in four languages, French, English, Italian and German. He also wrote a series of daily exercises for the mandolin, entitled\" La ginnastica del mandolino\", with the object of strengthening the fourth finger, and a volume of\" Ascending and descending major and minor scales in all positions for the mandolin\". He wrote\" Six duos for two mandolins\" and a\" Theoretical treatise on the rudiments of music\". In addition to his mandolin books, Bellenghi was the first to write and publish a method for the modern lute, and under the name\" G. B. Pirani\", methods for mandola and guitar. The most popular of his compositions were the waltzes\" Profumi Orientali\" and\" Renato\", both of which rapidly passed many editions. When it was published,\" Renato\" was\" the foremost composition for mandolin band\". Profumi Orientali was also arranged by its author as a song with French, Italian, and English words. Bellenghi wrote many pieces for piano solo and two pianos, songs with piano or guitar accompaniments, and about seventy various arrangements and original compositions for mandolin band. He also wrote about fifty similar works for guitar solo. He wrote a set of\" Variations for the mandolin\" with accompaniment of piano or guitar\u2014variations of Paganini's variations on the\" Carnival of Venice\". Biographer Philp J. Bone said that\" this work alone, places Bellenghi in the foremost rank as a mandolin virtuoso and thorough artist on the instrument, who enlarged its scope and extended its musical possibilities, as nothing of so advanced a nature for the mandolin had been published hitherto.\" Bellinghi died when he was 55.

            "Balanathan Benjamin Mahendran (20 May 1939 13 February 2014), commonly known as Balu Mahendra, was a legendary cinematographer, director, screenwriter and film editor who worked predominantly in Tamil cinema. Born in a Eelam Tamil family, he developed a passion for photography and literature at a young age. After witnessing the shoot of David Lean's \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) during a school trip in Sri Lanka, he was drawn towards filmmaking. He graduated from the London University and started his career as a draughtsman with the Sri Lankan Government. In 1966, he moved to India and gained admission to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to pursue a course in motion picture photography. Upon completion of his diploma, he entered Malayalam cinema as a cinematographer in the early 1970s. After working in over 20 films as a cinematographer, Mahendra made his directorial debut in 1977 with the Kannada film \"Kokila\". Since then, he directed over 20 films in a span of 36 years. Along with P. Bharathiraja and J. Mahendran, he is regarded as a trendsetter in Tamil cinema. During the tail end of his career, he established a film school in Chennai, which offers courses in cinematography, direction and acting. Following a brief phase of poor health, Mahendra died of cardiac arrest in February 2014. Widely regarded as an auteur, Mahendra usually scripted and edited his films apart from shooting them. He was the recipient of six National Film Awards (including two for Best Cinematography), five Filmfare Awards South and several state government awards.",
            "Moondram Pirai  is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written, directed and filmed by Balu Mahendra. The film stars Kamal Haasan and Sridevi, while Silk Smitha, Poornam Vishwanathan and Y. G. Mahendran play supporting roles. It revolves around a school teacher who rescues a woman suffering from retrograde amnesia, from a brothel, and protects her in his house located in Ketti. The rest of the film shows how the woman recovers her memory with the teacher's help. \"Moondram Pirai\" is based on Balu Mahendra's brief relationship with actress Shoba, who died in 1980, shortly after their marriage. The first film independently produced by G. Thyagarajan and G. Saravanan's Sathya Jyothi Films, it was predominantly shot in Ooty and Ketti, with further shooting also taking place in Bangalore. The music for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics written by Kannadasan, Vairamuthu and Gangai Amaran. It also featured the last song written by Kannadasan to be recorded before his death in 1981. \"Moondram Pirai\" was released on 19 February 1982 to positive critical reception. It was also a box office success and had a theatrical run of 329 days. The film won two National Film Awards: Best Actor for Haasan, and Best Cinematography for Mahendra. It also won the Best Director Award for Mahendra at the Filmfare Awards, and five Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, including Best Film (third prize), Best Actor (Haasan) and Best Actress (Sridevi). Mahendra remade the film in Hindi as \"Sadma\", with Haasan, Sridevi and Smita reprising their roles."

            "Human Traffic is a 1999 British- Irish independent film written and directed by Welsh filmmaker Justin Kerrigan. It is a cult film of the Cool Cymru era of arts in Wales. The film explores themes of coming of age, drug and club cultures, as well as relationships. It includes scenes provoking social commentary and the use of archive footage to provide political commentary. The plot of the film revolves around five twenty- something friends and their wider work and social circle, the latter devotees of the club scene, taking place over the course of a drug- fuelled weekend in Cardiff, Wales. A central feature is the avoidance of moralising about the impact of 1990s dance lifestyle; instead the film concentrates on recreating the\" vibe, the venues and the mood\" of the dance movement from the 1988 \u2013 89\" second summer of love\" to the film's release in 1999. In the first 25 minutes of the film Lee, the 17- year- old brother of central character Nina, enthuses\" I am about to be part of the chemical generation\" and lists, using the slang of the period, a series of drugs that he might experiment with later that night. The film is narrated by one of the stars, John Simm, featuring numerous cameo appearances. It is also the film debut of Danny Dyer as well as referencing another drug culture film of the era,\" Trainspotting\". With an original budget of \u00a3 340,000, the production eventually came in for \u00a3 2,200,000; the film was a financial success, taking in \u00a3 2,500,000 at the UK box office alone, also enjoying good VHS and DVD sales. \" Human Traffic\" was critically well- received with largely positive reviews, and has achieved cult status, especially amongst subcultures such as the rave culture. A sequel, known as\" Human Traffic 2: Revolution\" was announced in April 2019 and is due for release at an unknown date. Dyer, Parkes and Reynolds are due to reprise their roles."

Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in\" The Lamb\", was released prior to this picture. The film features the Siege of B\u00e9xar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto. While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in San Antonio in 1836 as a group of ill- mannered drunks. One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her. The white woman reports the incident to her husband, Almeron Dickinson, who in turn shoots the Mexican officer. In his book\" Remembering the Alamo\", author Richard R.

            "\"Jag skiter\" is a song written and recorded by Magnus Uggla for the album \" Va ska man ta livet av sig f\u00f6r n\u00e4r man \u00e4nd\u00e5 inte f\u00e5r h\u00f6ra snacket efter\u00e5t\" in 1977. The song lyrics encourage not to just listen to what other people think about someone, and also tackles the adult society's requests from the adult world. The song caused controversy, though Magnus Uggla himself said he didn't understand why, since the song was written in a humorist way, based on a joke he'd ridden in a [[Nisse Strix] issue], (\"de s\u00e4ger att jag skiter i allt, men det skiter jag i!\"). In 2003, the song was recorded by [[Elin Ek (actress)|Grynet]], releasing it as a single peaking at second position on the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish singles chart]]. This version replaced the lines \"De \u00e4r b\u00f6gar allihopa\" with \"De \u00e4r puckon allihopa\"."

            "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\". John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over \u00a3300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a \"melodic genius\" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.",
            "\"Rock And Roll Madonna\" is a song by Elton John with lyrics written by Bernie Taupin. The song was released as a single in Britain in 1970, where it never charted. It appeared on several bootlegs and rarities compilations, such as 1992's Rare Masters, before it appeared on the 1995 remaster of his \"self-titled album\". The song structure is, as the title says, a rock and roll song. Live-effects have been added, with an audience cheering throughout most of the song, a technique that would be used similarly three years later on Bennie and the Jets. The b-side, \"Grey Seal\", was rerecorded in 1973 for inclusion on John's seventh album \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\". The song was remade in an \"interlude\" version for the 2019 film \"Rocketman\" with star Taron Egerton performing the vocal."

During World War I, Victor Emmanuel III accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Paolo Boselli and named Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (the \"premier of victory\") in his place. Following the March on Rome, he appointed Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister and later deposed him in 1943 during World War II. Victor Emmanuel abdicated his throne in 1946 in favour of his son Umberto II, hoping to strengthen support for the monarchy against an ultimately successful referendum to abolish it.

            "Claude Henri Jean Chabrol (24 June 1930 \u2013 12 September 2010) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave (\"nouvelle vague\") group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s. Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\" before beginning his career as a film maker. Chabrol's career began with \"Le Beau Serge\" (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in \"Les Biches\" (1968), \"La Femme infid\u00e8le\" (1969), and \"Le Boucher\" (1970) \u2013 all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran, who was his wife at the time. Sometimes characterized as a \"mainstream\" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in \"Violette Nozi\u00e8re\". On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful \"Madame Bovary\" (1991) and \"La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie\" (1996). Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that \"there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper, if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium... Some of his films become almost private jokes, made to amuse himself.\" James Monaco has called Chabrol \"the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave, and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we don't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard.\""

            "The Naked Brothers Band is an 2007 American children's musical comedy film written and directed by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The film is emboldened by Nat's band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends Joshua Kaye, Thomas Batuello, and David Levi, who all portray themselves. It also includes Allie DiMeco as Nat's fictional female interest, the siblings' real- life cousin Jesse Draper as the group's babysitter, Draper's husband Michael Wolff playing his sons' widowed accordion- playing dad, and real life friends Cooper Pillot and Cole Hawkins portraying the other members of the band. Draper shot the film in the style of a mockumentary \u2014 a parody in documentary format\u2014that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, yet one song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot. In late 2005, Polly Draper, known for her role in\" Thirtysomething\", and her jazz musician husband Michael Wolff entered the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival, where it won the audience award. Former Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht attended the screening and purchased the movie, in association with his Worldwide Biggies label. It became the pilot for the subsequent Nickelodeon show of the same name, airing in the United States on January 27, 2007. The series was created and produced by Draper and premiered in February 2007, to the channel's highest ratings in seven years for viewers in the 6\u201311 age group.",

            "\"A House Without Love\" is a song composed by Hank Williams. It was released as the B-side to \"Why Don't You Love Me\" in 1950 on MGM Records.",
            "Hiram \"Hank\" Williams (September 17, 1923 \u2013 January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the \"Louisiana Hayride\" radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation \"for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\""

            "Abu'l Ghazi Sultan Alqas Mirza , better known as Alqas Mirza (b. 15 March 1516 - d. 9 April 1550), was a Safavid prince and the second son of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524). In early 1546, with Ottoman help, he staged a revolt against his brother Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576), who was king at the time.",
            "Ismail I (July 17, 1487 \u2013 May 23, 1524), also known as Shah Ismail I , was the founder of the Safavid dynasty, ruling from 1501 to 23 May 1524 as Shah of Iran (Persia). The rule of Ismail is one of the most vital in the history of Iran. Before his accession in 1501, Iran, since its conquest by the Arabs eight-and-a-half centuries before, had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule, but had been controlled by a series of Arab caliphs, Turkic sultans, and Mongol khans. Although many Iranian dynasties rose to power amidst this whole period, it was only under the Buyids that a vast part of Iran proper came under Iranian rule (945-1055). The dynasty founded by Ismail I would rule for over two centuries, being one of the greatest Iranian empires and at its height being amongst the most powerful empires of its time, ruling all of present-day Iran, Azerbaijan Republic, Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of modern-day Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. It also reasserted the Iranian identity in large parts of Greater Iran. The legacy of the Safavid Empire was also the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy, its architectural innovations and its patronage for fine arts. One of his first actions, was the proclamation of the Twelver sect of Shia Islam to be the official religion of his newly-formed state, which had major consequences for the ensuing history of Iran. Furthermore, this drastic act also gave him a political benefit of separating the growing Safavid state from its strong Sunni neighbors\u2014the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Uzbek confederation to the east. However, it brought into the Iranian body politic the implied inevitability of consequent conflict between the shah, the design of a \"secular\" state, and the religious leaders, who saw all secular states as unlawful and whose absolute ambition was a theocratic state. Ismail was also a prolific poet who, under the pen name Kha\u1e6d\u0101\u02be\u012b (which means \"he who made a mistake\" or \"he who was wrong\" in Persian), contributed greatly to the literary development of the Azerbaijani language. He also contributed to Persian literature, though few of his Persian writings survive."

            "George Harrison (25 February 1943 \u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"TaxmanWithin You Without YouWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHere Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978. Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. \" Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost \u00a3100 million.",
            "\"Living in the Material World\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison that was released as the title track of his 1973 album. In the song's lyrics, Harrison contrasts the world of material concerns with his commitment to a spiritual path, and the conflict is further represented in the musical arrangement as the rock accompaniment alternates with sections of Indian sounds. Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation, and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith. The contrasts presented in \"Living in the Material World\" inspired the Last Supper-style photograph by Ken Marcus that appeared inside the album's gatefold cover, and also designer Tom Wilkes's incorporation of Krishna-related symbolism elsewhere in the packaging. Harrison references his Beatles past as one of the trappings of the material world and refers by name to each of his three former bandmates. Ringo Starr, the Beatles' former drummer, plays drums on the track, which was recorded in England between October 1972 and February 1973. The rock portions include a slide guitar solo by Harrison, saxophone solos, two drummers, and prominent Hammond organ, while the meditative Indian interludes feature flute, tabla and a rare post-Beatle sitar contribution from Harrison. Jim Horn, Gary Wright and Zakir Hussain are among the other musicians on the recording. The production and musicianship on the track has received favourable comments from several reviewers. On release, Stephen Holden of \"Rolling Stone\" described the song as \"an incantatory, polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto-on-sitar refrain\". In addition to providing the title for the \"Living in the Material World\" album, it inspired Harrison's choice for a name for his charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation, to which he donated his publishing royalties from the composition. The 2006 reissue of the album includes a film clip of \"Living in the Material World\", featuring archival footage of the vinyl LP's manufacturing process. Film-maker Martin Scorsese used the song's title for that of his 2011 ."

            "Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 \u2013 8 September 1949) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, and violinist. Considered a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras, he has been described as a successor of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Along with Gustav Mahler, he represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. Strauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with tone poems and operas. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was \"Don Juan\" (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including \"Death and Transfiguration\" (1890), \"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\" (1895), \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" (1896), \"Don Quixote\" (1897), \"Ein Heldenleben\" (1898), \"Symphonia Domestica\" (1905), and \"An Alpine Symphony\" (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was \"Salome\" (1905) which used a libretto by Hedwig Lachmann that was a German translation of the French play \"Salom\u00e9\" by Oscar Wilde. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal: \"Elektra\" (1909), \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1911), \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" (1912, rev. 1916), \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" (1919), \"Die \u00e4gyptische Helena\" (1928), and \"Arabella\" (1933). His last operas, \"Daphne\" (1938), \"Friedenstag\" (1938), \"Die Liebe der Danae\" (1940) and \"Capriccio\" (1942) used libretti written by Joseph Gregor, the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, lieder (especially his \"Four Last Songs\" from 1948), the Violin Concerto in D minor (1882), the Horn Concerto No. 1 (1883), Horn Concerto No. 2 (1943), his Oboe Concerto and other instrumental works such as \"Metamorphosen\" (1945). Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of Hans von B\u00fclow , Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the Meiningen Court Orchestra in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the Bavarian State Opera where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's \"Tannh\u00e4user\" with his wife, soprano Pauline de Ahna, singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the Berlin State Opera from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the Vienna State Opera, and in 1920 he co-founded the Salzburg Festival. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally. In 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of Nazi Germany: head of the Reichsmusikkammer and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor Arturo Toscanini had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera \"Die schweigsame Frau\" (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera \"Friedenstag\", which premiered just before the outbreak of World War II, was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in Nazi concentration camps. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a denazification tribunal in Munich.",

The building was the tallest in the state of Virginia from 1967 to 1971, when it was overtaken by Richmond City Hall. Today, it is the second- tallest building in City of Norfolk. The tower was constructed in 1965- 67 and designed by Skidmore, Owings& Merrill, one of Virginia's leading architectural firms of the period. It has a long history in banking. Built as the original headquarters for Virginia National Bank( VNB), the building retained headquarters status for Sovran Bank, formed from the merger of VNB and First& Merchants Bank of Richmond in 1983. After a series of mergers beginning in 1990( including NationsBank), the building became the regional office for its namesake Bank of America in 1998. In 2010, local reports were published of the building losing tenants, especially to newer office towers in Downtown Norfolk, such as the Wells Fargo Center. However, shipping company Maersk Line Limited retained its headquarters in the building. In late 2015, plans were announced to convert the building to a 300- unit luxury apartment tower with ground- level retail. The building was renamed Icon Norfolk, part of a larger project known as CityWalk which will also entail redeveloping an adjacent office building at 2 Commercial Place. In August 2016, Bank of America announced its intent to relocate its offices( and its building- top signage) to the 999 Waterside Drive, the former Dominion Tower, a few blocks away. The tower has now been completely remodeled into Icon Norfolk apartments, and the address has been changed to 321 E. Main Street."

The village appears in the Domesday Book as Golburg or Goldeburgh, which means Golda's Burgh( with Burgh meaning borough). It was in the possession of the de Goldesburgh, Hutton and Byerley families at that time. A Viking hoard was discovered in Goldsborough Village in 1859 during construction outside the north wall of Goldsborough Church. Coins and artefacts dating from 700 to 1050 were found in a leaden chest including fragments of Viking brooches and arm rings, together with 39 coins. It forms one of the largest collections ever discovered in the UK and is now held at the British Museum in London. The village has a Church of England affiliated primary school which takes pupils from the surrounding settlements of Allerton, Coneythorpe, Hopperton and Flaxby.

            "Arthur Biedl (4 October 1869 \u2013 26 August 1933) was a Hungarian pathologist born in what today is Comlo\u015fu Mic, Romania. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, and from 1893 served as an assistant to Salomon Stricker (1834-1898), Philipp Knoll (1841-1900) and Richard Paltauf (1858-1924) at the institute of experimental pathology in Vienna. In 1899 he became an associate professor, followed by a full professorship in 1902. In 1898, Biedl and colleague R. Kraus demonstrated that \"bile salts,\" when injected into the bloodstream of animals, failed to elicit a behavioral change. They hypothesized that this was due to a semipermeable membrane that protected the central nervous system from the passive diffusion of solutes in the bloodstream. Two years later, Max Lewandowsky coined the term \"Blood\u2013brain barrier\" when these findings were confirmed with other biological compounds. Edwin Goldmann and his mentor Paul Ehrlich further confirmed these findings with aniline dyes injected inside and outside of the brain. He is considered a founder of modern endocrinology. In 1910, Biedl published a landmark textbook on endocrinology called \"Innere Sekretion\" (Internal Secretions), which was a thorough study on glands and their secretions. In 1922, he described his studies of two sisters who had retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, hypogonadism as well as obesity. Two years earlier Georges Bardet (1885\u20131966) at the University of Paris described the same symptoms in two sisters unrelated to Biedl's findings. This syndrome is now called the Bardet-Biedl syndrome after the two men. A similar disease was originally named the \"Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome\", together with two English physicians, John Zachariah Laurence (1829\u20131870) and Robert Charles Moon (1845\u20131914). Today this disease has been shortened to become the Laurence-Moon syndrome, while the Bardet-Biedl syndrome is recognized as a separate entity. In 1928 he founded the journal \"Endokrinologie\"."

            "Ibrahim Sharif was Bey of Tunis from 1702 to 1705, during the period of crisis which brought an end to the Muradid dynasty and preceded the rise to power of Husayn I Bey. Lieutenant of the Muradid Beys of Tunis, Ibrahim was at various points Agha of the sipahis( commander of the cavalry of the Turkish militia) and Agha of the janissaries( commander of the rifleman) to the final Muradid princes. During a trip to Istanbul to recruit jannissaries, a new war was declared between Murad III Bey and the Dey of Algiers; the Ottoman court, no longer able to control Murad III, ordered Ibrahim to return to Tunisia and arrest him. At the outset of the military campaign, on the banks of the Wadi Zarka, Ibrahim struck Murad III with a blow from his blunderbuss, before killing him in the presence of his other lieutenants. On his return to Tunis Sharif assassinated all the remaining princes of the Muradid dynasty in order to seize power for himself- the two young sons of Muhammad al- Hafsi al- Muradi, second son of Hammouda Pacha Bey, along with Hussein Bey, the third son of Hammouda Pacha Bey and his own son who was only four years old. Proclaimed Bey by the janissary militia, he was the first Bey not to be a Muradid in over a century. He was also designated Pasha by the Ottomans, as a reward for bringing an end to hostilities and subsequently was elected Dey of Tunis by the Ottoman divan of Tunis. He promptly abolished the title and powers of the Dey. Although he had accumulated all the offices at the head of the Tunisian beylik, he did not manage to put an end to the revolts and agitation begun after the death of the last Muradids. After he was defeated by the Dey of Algiers near Kef on 8 July 1705, he was captured and taken to Algiers, which led to the establishment of the Husainid dynasty after his own Agha of the Sipahis, Al- Husayn I ibn Ali at- Turki seized power. On his return to Tunis on 10 July, he was proclaimed Bey of Tunis. Ibrahim, freed by the Dey of Algiers, attempted to retake Tunis in order to avenge himself and regain power, but he was assassinated on the way at the order of Husayn I Bey at Ghar el- Melh. His tomb is located at the foot of the city's fort.",

He was born and grew up in middle-class family in the working-class city of Norrk\u00f6ping and was the younger brother of the Swedish Communist leader Ture Nerman. Einar Nerman also had a twin brother, Birger Nerman, who was an archeologist. Einar Nerman dropped out of his Norrk\u00f6ping Gymnasium High School in 1905 and moved to Stockholm to study art. In 1908 he moved to France for many years to pursue his interest in art, studying with Matisse at the Academie Matisse in Paris. When he came back to Sweden in 1912 he started studying music and taking dance lessons. In the 1920s Nerman lived in London and drew images for \"The Tatler\". During World War II, he lived and worked in New York City. Einar Nerman wrote songs and music and composed music to many of his brother Ture Nerman\u2019s poems. He also made many of the artistic book covers for his Communist brother's published writings. Einar Nerman also made illustrations for many of the books by Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. In Sweden today, he is mostly known, or unknown, for being the man behind the art of the Solstickan matchbox. He also made some famous drawings of Greta Garbo, one of which was used on a postage stamp in 2005, a hundred years after the moviestar's birth. Nerman owned and inhabited Hersbyholm in Liding\u00f6, Sweden. He bought the property in 1930. A book of his drawings appeared in 1976: \"Caught in the Act\" (Harrap, London) with an introduction by his friend, lyricist Sandy Wilson. It contained many caricatures of friends in the London theatre world. From 1922 to 1930 he was the theatre cartoonist for \"The Tatler\" and also worked for the fashionable magazine \"Eve.\" The book is dedicated to Ivor Novello whom he had met in Stockholm in 1918. In the 1940s in New York he worked for the Journal-American. There is much additional information in \"Caught in the Act\", as well as examples of his work, sometimes said to be \"Beardsleyesque\", and his celebrity caricatures are as distinctive as those of Ralph Barton."

            "Cecil Blount DeMille (August 12, 1881 \u2013 January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker. Between 1914 and 1958, he made a total of 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films were more diverse in genre, among which included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years. DeMille directed \"The King of Kings\" (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. \" The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic which became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. His last and best known film, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\" (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor. DeMille's reputation as a filmmaker has grown over time and his work has influenced many other films and directors."

In the scorching heat of a Western Australian summer in 1957, Patterson stepped into Lex Davison's Ferrari 625 F1 as a relief driver, working together to defeat Stan Jones to win the 1957 Australian Grand Prix. A succession of grand prix Coopers followed. The biggest year of Patterson's career was 1961. Victories at Mount Panorama, Lowood, Caversham and a second at Longford saw Patterson dominate the 1961 Australian Drivers' Championship, scoring 51 points to Lex Davison's 15 to win the Gold Star. Patterson raced on for a few more years and took part in the inaugural Tasman Series in 1964, but after that Patterson stepped away from the sport as a driver, but stayed as an entrant, sponsor and team boss.

            "Do n't Look Now( lit. \" In Venice ... a shocking red December\") is a 1973 independent film directed by Nicolas Roeg. It is a thriller adapted from the short story by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after the husband accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger. The husband at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself. While\" Do n't Look Now\" observes many conventions of the thriller genre, it focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship. Its depiction of grief has been identified as unusually strong for a film featuring supernatural plot elements. \" Do n't Look Now\" is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of then- contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques. Its reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film.",

The film has the distinction of being the first full- length feature to use computer- generated imagery for the synthesis of human visual speech. 2 D warping techniques were used to digitally animate the mouth viseme shapes of the babies which were originally shot with their mouths closed. The viseme shapes were sampled from syllables uttered by the babies on the set. The film grossed over$ 36 million worldwide. In 2004, it was followed by a sequel,. In 2011, an original series was announced. The series has so far aired in Italy and the Far East. Additionally, the series was released as a set of movies. \" Baby Geniuses and the Mystery of the Crown Jewels\", which features episodes 1 \u2013 4, was released directly to video in 2013.

Making his directorial debut 23 years after his entry into the film business, Roeg quickly became known for an idiosyncratic visual and narrative style, characterized by the use of disjointed and disorienting editing. For this reason, he is considered a highly influential filmmaker, with such directors as Steven Soderbergh, Christopher Nolan, and Danny Boyle citing him as such. In 1999, the British Film Institute acknowledged Roeg's importance in the British film industry by respectively naming\" Do n't Look Now\" and\" Performance\" the 8th and 48th greatest British films of all time in its Top 100 British films poll."

            "\"Hernando's Hideaway\" is a tango show tune, largely in long metre, from the musical \"The Pajama Game\", written by Jerry Ross and Richard Adler and published in 1954. It was sung in the stage and film versions of the musical by Carol Haney. The most successful recording of the song was done by Archie Bleyer, the record reaching No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" chart in 1954. A version by Johnnie Ray hit #14. A rendition by Enoch Light was featured prominently on Command Records' \"Provocative Percussion\" as well as the \"Command test record\". It has also been covered by David Clayton Thomas, and is often played by breakbeat DJs. The R&B singer Debelah Morgan sampled it (with different lyrics and a new middle section) on her international pop hit \"Dance With Me\" released in 2000. The instrumental section of The Johnston Brothers' 1955 recording (a No. 1 UK hit that year) was used as the theme for Brick Top Polford in the movie \"Snatch\". A live recording (from Carnegie Hall in 1954) by Ella Fitzgerald can be found on the Verve/Polygram release \"Jazz at the Philharmonic, the Ella Fitzgerald Set\", with Ray Brown on bass and Buddy Rich on drums. \"The Pajama Game\" is set in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hernando's Hideaway was a raunchy dive in East Dubuque, Illinois, perched on a high cliff overlooking the highway between Dubuque and Galena. The movie was based on the stage play of the same name which, in turn, was based on the book (7 1/2 Cents, by Richard Bissell); it is only in the original book that there is information about where the story takes place. A number of places around the world today are named Hernando's Hideaway, evidently based on the popularity of the song. There are at least 15 Finnish versions by different artists of the song, the first and most popular by Olavi Virta, in 1956. \"Hernando's Hideaway\" also became a nickname for the smoking room for British parliamentarians in the House of Commons. The Labour Member of Parliament, Stephen Pound, told the House during a smoking debate on February 14, 2006: \"I refer the House to the dystopic hell \u2013 'Hernando's Hideaway' \u2013 that is the Smoking Room on the Library Corridor. It is like the Raft of the Medusa most nights, with great groups of people crammed into it.\" In 2014, the song was featured on the popular FOX show So You Think You Can Dance during its 11th season. The routine got Spencer Liff nominated for an Emmy in 2015 for Outstanding Choreography."

            "Alexandre-Pierre Georges \"Sacha\" Guitry (21 February 188524 July 1957) was a French stage actor, film actor, director, screenwriter, and playwright of the Boulevard theatre. He was the son of a leading French actor, Lucien Guitry, and followed his father into the theatrical profession. He became known for his stage performances, often in boulevardier roles, in the many plays he wrote, of which there were more than 120. He was married five times, always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered. Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932. Guitry's plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including Andr\u00e9 Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year. The later years of Guitry's career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War. The charges were dismissed, but Guitry, a strongly patriotic man, was disillusioned by the vilification by some of his compatriots. By the time of his death his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris."

Like his father, Babur, he lost his kingdom early but regained it with the aid of the Safavid dynasty of Persia, with additional territory. At the time of his death in 1556, the Mughal Empire spanned almost one million square kilometres. In December 1530, Humayun succeeded his father to the throne of Delhi as ruler of the Mughal territories in the Indian subcontinent. Humayun was an inexperienced ruler when he came to power, at the age of 22. His half-brother Kamran Mirza inherited Kabul and Kandahar, the northernmost parts of their father's empire. Mirza was to become a bitter rival of Humayun. Humayun lost Mughal territories to Sher Shah Suri, but regained them 15 years later with Safavid aid. Humayun's return from Persia was accompanied by a large retinue of Persian noblemen and signalled an important change in Mughal court culture. The Central Asian origins of the dynasty were largely overshadowed by the influences of Persian art, architecture, language, and literature. There are many stone carvings and thousands of Persian manuscripts in India dating from the time of Humayun. Subsequently, Humayun further expanded the Empire in a very short time, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, Akbar.",

He directed classic films from the silent era and numerous others during Hollywood's Golden Age, when the studio system was prevalent. Curtiz was already a well-known director in Europe when Warner Bros. invited him to Hollywood in 1926, when he was 39 years of age. He had already directed 64 films in Europe, and soon helped Warner Bros. become the fastest-growing movie studio. He directed 102 films during his Hollywood career, mostly at Warners, where he directed ten actors to Oscar nominations. James Cagney and Joan Crawford won their only Academy Awards under Curtiz's direction. He put Doris Day and John Garfield on screen for the first time, and he made stars of Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Bette Davis. He himself was nominated five times and won twice, once for Best Short Subject for \"Sons of Liberty\" and once as Best Director for \"Casablanca\". Curtiz introduced to Hollywood a unique visual style using artistic lighting, extensive and fluid camera movement, high crane shots, and unusual camera angles. He was versatile and could handle any kind of picture: melodrama, comedy, love story, film noir, musical, war story, Western, or historical epic. He always paid attention to the human-interest aspect of every story, stating that the \"human and fundamental problems of real people\" were the basis of all good drama. Curtiz helped popularize the classic swashbuckler with films such as \"Captain Blood\" (1935) and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). He directed many dramas which today are also considered classics, \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" (1938), \"The Sea Wolf\" (1941), \"Casablanca\" (1942), and \"Mildred Pierce\" (1945). He directed leading musicals, including \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), \" This Is the Army\" (1943), and \"White Christmas\", and he made comedies with \"Life With Father\" (1947) and \"We're No Angels\" (1955)."

He was one of the directors at Warner Bros. in the 1930s who helped give that studio its reputation for gritty, fast-paced \"torn from the headlines\" action films. And, in directing Warner Bros.' \"42nd Street\", he joined the movie's song-and-dance-number director, Busby Berkeley, in contributing to \"an instant and enduring classic [that] transformed the musical genre.\""

            "\"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\" is a hit song written by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer for the movie musical \"The Sky's the Limit\" (1943) and first performed in the film by Fred Astaire. It was further popularized by Frank Sinatra. Harold Arlen described the song as \"another typical Arlen tapeworm\" \u2013 a \"tapeworm\" being the trade slang for any song which went over the conventional 32 bar length. He called it \"a wandering song. [Lyricist] Johnny [Mercer] took it and wrote it exactly the way it fell. Not only is it long \u2013 forty-eight bars \u2013 but it also changes key. Johnny made it work. \" In the opinion of Arlen's biographer, Edward Jablonski, the song is \"musically inevitable, rhythmically insistent, and in that mood of 'metropolitan melancholic beauty' that writer John O'Hara finds in all of Arlen's music.\" Sinatra recorded the song several times during his career: In 1947 with Columbia Records, in 1954 for the film soundtrack album \"Young at Heart\", in 1958 for \"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\", in 1962 for , in 1966 for \"Sinatra at the Sands\" and finally, in 1993, for his \"Duets\" album. At a Johnny Carson-hosted Rat Pack concert at the Kiel Opera House in St. Louis in 1965, Sammy Davis Jr., backed by Quincy Jones conducting the Count Basie Orchestra, performed the song imitating the styles of successively Fred Astaire, Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Vaughn Monroe, Tony Bennett, Mel Torm\u00e9, Frankie Laine, Louis Armstrong, an inebriated Dean Martin, and Jerry Lewis.",

Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Retired Emperor until his death in 1799; he thus was one of the longest-reigning \"de facto\" rulers in the history of the world, and dying at the age of 87, one of the longest-lived. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms. This turned around in his late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and wastefulness in his court and a stagnating civil society. A British valet who accompanied his diplomat master to the Qing court in 1793 described the emperor: The Emperor is about five feet ten inches in height, and of a slender but elegant form; his complexion is comparatively fair, though his eyes are dark; his nose is rather aquiline, and the whole of his countenance presents a perfect regularity of feature, which, by no means, announce the great age he is said to have attained; his person is attracting, and his deportment accompanied by an affability, which, without lessening the dignity of the prince, evinces the amiable character of the man.

            "Virginia Terhune Van de Water (1865\u20131945) was a writer. Three of her stories were adapted to film: \"If My Country Should Call\" (1916), \"The Lesson\" (1917), and \"Two Sisters\" (1929). Vandewater was born in Newark, New Jersey. She was the daughter of author Mary Virginia Terhune and had siblings who also became writers (Albert Terhune and Christine Terhune Herrick). Her story \" In the Web of Life\" ran in the \"Los Angeles Herald\". Her book \"From Kitchen to Garret\" (1910) is a guide to housekeeping. Her book \"Why I Left My Husband, and Other Human Documents of Married Life\", a volume of stories originally published in 1912 in \"Good Housekeeping\" and \"The Cosmopolitan\", has been described by the literary critic Susan Fraiman as \"a collection of painfully disillusioned tales, unvarnished renderings of marital alienation from multiple perspectives, including that of a daughter driven from home to escape the cross fire. \" The stories describe various couples, some of whom remain separated and some of whom remain in unhappy marriages, and provide moral and emotional rationalizations for divorce. Towards the end of World War I, two pamphlets by Van de Water, entitled \"Women and Bolshevism\" and \"What the Victory or Defeat of Germany Means to Every American\", were published by the National Security League.",
            "Mary Virginia Terhune (n\u00e9e Hawes, December 21, 1830 \u2013 June 3, 1922), also known by her penname Marion Harland, was an American author who was prolific and bestselling in both fiction and non-fiction genres. Born in Amelia County, Virginia, she began her career writing articles at the age of 14, using various pennames until 1853, when she settled on Marion Harland. Her first novel \"Alone \" was published in 1854 and became an \"emphatic success\" following its second printing the next year. For fifteen years she was a prolific writer of best-selling women's novels, classified then as \"plantation fiction\", as well as writing numerous serial works, short stories, and essays for magazines. After marrying Presbyterian minister Edward Payson Terhune in 1856, Terhune moved with him to Newark, New Jersey and spent the remainder of her adult life in the North. They had six children together; three died as infants. In the 1870s, shortly after the birth of her last son Albert Payson, she published \"Common Sense in the Household: A Manual of Practical Housewifery\", a cookbook and domestic guide for housewives that became a huge bestseller, eventually selling more than one million copies over several editions. Terhune began to concentrate on non-fiction, publishing additional cookbooks and domestic works, as well as biographies, travel guides, and histories. She continued to write some novels. She spoke as a public lecturer and was the first woman elected to the Virginia Historical Society. In 1873, the Terhunes relocated to Europe for two years while Mary recovered from tuberculosis. After their return, they continued living in the northeastern United States, moving as her husband's job as a pastor demanded. After breaking her wrist in her seventies, Terhune learned to use a typewriter. In her 90s, she went blind, but continued work by dictating to a secretary. Her final work, the novel \"The Carringtons of High Hill\", was published in 1919. Terhune continued creating articles and essays until she died on June 2, 1922. Over her life, she published 25 novels, 25 non-fiction works on homemaking and cooking, three short story collections, several biographies, travel guides and histories, and numerous essays, articles, and serial works. Two of her children, Christine Terhune Herrick and Albert Payson Terhune, became noted writers as well, with Herrick following in her mother's footsteps as an authority of domestic matters, and Albert Terhune becoming notable for his novels featuring collies. Her middle child, Virginia Van de Water, also became a writer, though less well known. Late in life, Mary Terhune co-wrote works with each of them."

In the early 1930s he worked on several multi-language version films for UFA, producing the same films in distinct German and foreign-language versions.

            "Tzanata is an inland village in the southeast of Kefalonia, one of the Ionian Islands of Greece. It is part of the community of Poros within the Eleios- Pronnoi municipal unit. It is situated 3 km southwest of Poros, 25 km southeast of Sami and 36 km east of Argostoli. Along with the neighbouring villages of Agia Eirini and Kampitsata, it is situated in a fertile plain south of the Atros hill. The village has a small school, community centre and community clinic; a sports stadium to serve the local area is slowly being completed. A mineral water spring( vrysi) fed from the \u2018 bottomless \u2019 Avithos lake at Agios Nikolaos feeds a fountain in the plane tree sheltered square where the village festivals, served by souvlaki stalls and the adjacent taverna, are held in the summer months. Water from the surrounding mountains also feeds two reservoirs just outside the village, one completed in 2005 to feed the burgeoning summer demands of nearby Skala. In 1991 archaeologist Lazaros Kolonas, excavating in the Broutzi area of Tzanata, discovered a tholos( beehive) tomb from the Mycenaean period measuring 6.80 meters in diameter. Despite a claim that it is the burial place of Odysseus, it is generally believed to be the tomb of earlier royalty, circa 1400 BC. Nevertheless, it is the most important historical find on Kefalonia to date. The site is signposted from the Tzanata- Poros road. As the road to Poros enters the impressive Poros gorge, there is a rough vehicular track leading 4.5 km to Atros, the oldest monastery and surviving structure on Kefalonia."

            "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 \u2013 August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.",

            "Quakers, also called Friends, are a historically Christian group whose formal name is the Religious Society of Friends or Friends Church. Members of the various Quaker movements are all generally united by their belief in the ability of each human being to experientially access the light within, or \"that of God in every one\". Some may profess the priesthood of all believers, a doctrine derived from the First Epistle of Peter. They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity. There are also Nontheist Quakers whose spiritual practice is not reliant on the existence of God. To differing extents, the different movements that make up the Religious Society of Friends/Friends Church avoid creeds and hierarchical structures. In 2007, there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide. In 2017, there were 377,557 adult Quakers, with 49% in Africa. Around 89% of Quakers worldwide belong to the \"evangelical\" and \"programmed\" branches of Quakerism\u2014these Quakers worship in services with singing and a prepared message from the Bible, coordinated by a pastor. Around 11% of Friends practice \"waiting worship\", or \"unprogrammed worship\" (more commonly known today as \"Meeting for Worship\"), where the order of service is not planned in advance, is predominantly silent, and may include unprepared vocal ministry from those present. Some meetings of both types have Recorded Ministers in their meetings\u2014Friends recognised for their gift of vocal ministry. The first Quakers lived in mid-17th-century England. The movement arose from the Legatine-Arians and other dissenting Protestant groups, breaking away from the established Church of England. The Quakers, especially the ones known as the Valiant Sixty, attempted to convert others to their understanding of Christianity, travelling both throughout Great Britain and overseas, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. Some of these early Quaker ministers were women. They based their message on the religious belief that \"Christ has come to teach his people himself\", stressing the importance of a direct relationship with God through Jesus Christ, and a direct religious belief in the universal priesthood of all believers. They emphasized a personal and direct religious experience of Christ, acquired through both direct religious experience and the reading and studying of the Bible. Quakers focused their private life on developing behaviour and speech reflecting emotional purity and the light of God. In the past, Quakers were known for their use of \"thee\" as an ordinary pronoun, refusal to participate in war, plain dress, refusal to swear oaths, opposition to slavery, and teetotalism. Some Quakers founded banks and financial institutions, including Barclays, Lloyds, and Friends Provident; manufacturing companies, including shoe retailer C. & J. Clark and the big three British confectionery makers Cadbury, Rowntree and Fry; and philanthropic efforts, including abolition of slavery, prison reform, and social justice projects. In 1947, the Quakers, represented by the British Friends Service Council and the American Friends Service Committee, were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.",
            "Haverford College  is a private liberal arts college in Haverford, Pennsylvania. All students of the college are undergraduates and nearly all reside on campus. The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, Quaker philosophy still influences campus life. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1980. Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, and its enrollment, as of 2018, was 1,353 students. The college offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Haverford College is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which allows students to register for courses at both Bryn Mawr College and Swarthmore College. It is also a member of the Quaker Consortium which allows students to cross-register at the University of Pennsylvania. The college has produced, among others, 4 Nobel Prize Recipients, 6 Pulitzer Prize Recipients, 20 Rhodes Scholars, and 104 Fulbright Scholars."

Admitted at the age of seventeen to membership of the French Academy of Sciences, he was elected in 1696 a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and became \"ma\u00eetre des comptes\" in 1706. Having succeeded to his father's position at the observatory in 1712, he measured in 1713 the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan, and published the results in a volume entitled \" Trait\u00e9 de la grandeur et de la figure de la terre\" (1720). His two separate calculations for a degree of meridian arc were 57,097 \"toises de Paris\" (111.282 km) and 57,061 toises (111.211 km), giving results for Earth's radius of 3,271,420 toises (6,375.998 km) and 3,269,297 toises (6,371.860 km), respectively. He also wrote \"El\u00e9ments d'astronomie\" on proper motion (1740). He published the first tables of the satellites of Saturn in 1716. He died at Thury, near Clermont, France. The asteroid 24102 Jacquescassini is named after him. Jacques Cassini married Suzanne Fran\u00e7oise Charpentier de Charmois.

Cassini was born in Perinaldo, near Imperia, at that time in the County of Nice, part of the Savoyard state. Cassini is known for his work in the fields of astronomy and engineering. Cassini discovered four satellites of the planet Saturn and noted the division of the rings of Saturn; the Cassini Division was named after him. Giovanni Domenico Cassini was also the first of his family to begin work on the project of creating a topographic map of France. The \"Cassini\" space probe, launched in 1997, was named after him and became the fourth to visit the planet Saturn and the first to orbit the planet."

            "\"Be My Wife\" is a song by English musician David Bowie. It was the second single from \"Low\" (1977), released on 17 June 1977. Its presence in \"Low\" tones down the electronic feel of the rest of the album. The song also features a more conventional lyric which is closer to a traditional rock song than the more fragmented lyrics elsewhere on that album. The song features a ragtime piano opening, which serves the somewhat retro lyrics some justice, although it is soon set against a backdrop of guitars and drums. The song repeats its lyrics, changing the spacing of the lyrics amongst the song's verse. The song closes simply with a fadeout, as the song returns to the introductory ragtime riff repeating indefinitely, with the rest of the band playing behind it. \"Be My Wife\" became the first new Bowie release since \"Changes\" to fail to break into the UK chart. It was frequently played live on the various tours after its release and Bowie is said to have repeatedly announced this song during live performances as \"one of my favourites,\" as may be seen or heard in such concert footage or audio recordings.",
            "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 \u2013 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie , was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album \" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \" The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\" (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\"Heroes (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with \"The Next Day.\" He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, \"Blackstar\" (2016)."

Considered to be among the most accomplished and influential filmmakers of all time, Bergman's films include \"Smiles of a Summer Night\" (1955), \"The Seventh Seal\" (1957) , \"Wild Strawberries\" (1957), \"Persona\" (1966), \"Cries and Whispers\" (1972), \"Scenes from a Marriage\" (1973), and \"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982); the last two exist in extended television versions. Bergman directed over sixty films and documentaries for cinematic release and for television screenings, most of which he also wrote. He also directed over 170 plays. He eventually forged a creative partnership with his cinematographers Gunnar Fischer and Sven Nykvist. Among his company of actors were Harriet and Bibi Andersson, Liv Ullmann, Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Erland Josephson, Ingrid Thulin and Max von Sydow. Most of his films were set in Sweden, and many films from \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961) onward were filmed on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6. Philip French referred to Bergman as \"one of the greatest artists of the 20th century ... he found in literature and the performing arts a way of both recreating and questioning the human condition.\" Director Martin Scorsese commented; \"If you were alive in the 50s and the 60s and of a certain age, a teenager on your way to becoming an adult, and you wanted to make movies , I don't see how you couldn't be influenced by Bergman ... It's impossible to overestimate the effect that those films had on people.\""

            "Marcus Aurelius (or ; ; 26 April 121 \u2013 17 March 180) was Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic philosopher. He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He served as Roman consul in 140, 145, and 161. The son of the praetor Marcus Annius Verus (III) and the wealthy heiress Domitia Lucilla, Marcus was raised by his mother and by his grandfather, Marcus Annius Verus (II), after his father died. His uncle, Antoninus Pius, adopted him shortly before becoming emperor in 138. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek and Latin under tutors such as Herodes Atticus and Marcus Cornelius Fronto. He kept in close correspondence with Fronto for many years afterwards. Marcus married Antoninus' daughter Faustina in 145. Antoninus died following an illness in 161. The reign of Marcus Aurelius was marked by military conflict. In the East, the Roman Empire fought successfully with a revitalized Parthian Empire and the rebel Kingdom of Armenia. Marcus defeated the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatian Iazyges in the Marcomannic Wars; however, these and other Germanic peoples began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. He modified the silver purity of the Roman currency, the denarius. The persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire is believed to have increased during his reign. The Antonine Plague broke out in 165 or 166 and devastated the population of the Roman Empire, causing the deaths of five million people. Unlike some of his predecessors, Marcus chose not to adopt an heir. His children included Lucilla (who married Lucius Verus, co-emperor from 161 to 169) and Commodus, whose succession after Marcus has become a subject of debate among both contemporary and modern historians. The Column and Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius still stand in Rome, where they were erected in celebration of his military victories. \"Meditations\", the writings of \"the philosopher\" \u2013 as contemporary biographers called Marcus, are a significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy. They have been praised by fellow writers, philosophers, monarchs, and politicians centuries after his death.",

She was a Roman Empress and wife to her maternal cousin Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. She was held in high esteem by soldiers and her own husband and was given divine honours after her death."

            "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 \u2013 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie , was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album \" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \" The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\" (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\"Heroes (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with \"The Next Day.\" He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, \"Blackstar\" (2016).",
            "\"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" is a song written by David Bowie, first recorded in June 1969 and released as a B-side to his single \"Space Oddity\". Bowie then rerecorded the song for his second eponymous album (released in the U.S. as \"Man of Words, Man of Music\" by Mercury and reissued by RCA in 1972 as \"Space Oddity\"). The single version has sparse instrumentation: guitar (played by Bowie) and arco bass (by Paul Buckmaster). The album version, recorded in July/August 1969, features a full orchestral arrangement by Tony Visconti and is said to be the debut on a Bowie record of Mick Ronson, contributing uncredited lead guitar and handclaps midway through the track. Bowie himself said of the song: \"It was about the disassociated, the ones who feel as though they're left outside, which was how I felt about me. I always felt I was on the edge of events, the fringe of things, and left out. A lot of my characters in those early years seem to revolve around that feeling. It must have come from my own interior puzzlement at where I was\"."

It is located in the town of Chesterfield, New York, United States, on New York state Forest Preserve land, part of the Taylor Pond Wild Forest complex within the Adirondack Park.

            "Charles Byron Griffith (September 23, 1930 \u2013 September 28, 2007) was a Chicago-born screenwriter, actor and film director, son of Donna Dameral, radio star of \"Myrt and Marge\", along with Charles' grandmother, Myrtle Vail, and was best known for writing Roger Corman productions such as \"A Bucket of Blood\" (1959), \"The Little Shop of Horrors\" (1960), and \"Death Race 2000\" (1975). He was credited with 29 movies, but is known to have written many more. He had also directed at least six films, acted in six films, was second unit director in six films, produced three films and was production manager of two films. During the late fifties and early sixties, Griffith created both redneck classics such as \"Eat My Dust\" and black comedies such as \"A Bucket of Blood\" and \"The Little Shop of Horrors\". He had a small role in \"It Conquered the World\", which he also wrote, as Dr. Pete Shelton. Griffith died on September 28, 2007 in San Diego, aged 77, from undisclosed causes. Quentin Tarantino dedicated his film \"Deathproof\" to Griffith, whom he referred to as one of his main influences and called \"the father of redneck cinema\"."

He has directed all his films under his father's production company\" Trimurti Films\". He made his debut as a director with the 1985 action film\" Yudh\". He went on to write and direct several hit films in the action and thriller genres:\" Tridev\"( 1989),\" Vishwatma\"( 1992),\" Mohra\"( 1994), and\" Gupt\"( 1997).

He married Bollywood actress Sonam, whom he had directed in\" Tridev\" and\" Vishwatma\" in 1989 and 1992 respectively. He has one child with her. They divorced in 2016. In 1997, he had to leave India with his family for the UK after a failed attempt to kill him by hitmen believed to be working for the Mumbai underworld leader Abu Salem. After a four- year hiatus from the Bollywood industry, he returned to directing by introducing Arjun Rampal with his comeback venture\" Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat\"( 2001). This was an attempt by Rai at directing a romantic drama, a change from his previous action films. The film failed at the box office and Rai returned to the action genre with his next film\" Asambhav\"( 2004), again starring Arjun Rampal, which also failed to do well. Shortly after the release of\" Asambhav\" his father died at the age of 80 of a prolonged illness.

Khufu succeeded his father Sneferu as king. He is generally accepted as having commissioned the Great Pyramid of Giza, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but many other aspects of his reign are poorly documented. The only completely preserved portrait of the king is a three-inch high ivory figurine found in a temple ruin of a later period at Abydos in 1903. All other reliefs and statues were found in fragments, and many buildings of Khufu are lost. Everything known about Khufu comes from inscriptions in his necropolis at Giza and later documents. For example, Khufu is the main character noted in the Westcar Papyrus from the 13th dynasty. Most documents that mention king Khufu were written by ancient Egyptian and Greek historians around 300 BC. Khufu's obituary is presented there in a conflicting way: while the king enjoyed a long-lasting cultural heritage preservation during the period of the Old Kingdom and the New Kingdom, the ancient historians Manetho, Diodorus and Herodotus hand down a very negative depiction of Khufu's character. Thanks to these documents, an obscure and critical picture of Khufu's personality persists."

He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. During his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until age 16. After Philip's assassination in 336 BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of Anatolia, Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Beas River. Alexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the Pauravas at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in Babylon in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Diadochi: Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history."

The recording features a tenor sax solo by Willis Jackson.

She was noted for bringing a pop music style to R&B music in a series of hit songs for Atlantic Records in the 1950s, such as \"So LongTeardrops from My Eyes\" and \"(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean\". For these contributions, Atlantic became known as \"the house that Ruth built\" (alluding to the popular nickname for the old Yankee Stadium). Following a resurgence that began in the mid-1970s and peaked in the 1980s, Brown used her influence to press for musicians' rights regarding royalties and contracts; these efforts led to the founding of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. Her performances in the Broadway musical \"Black and Blue\" earned Brown a Tony Award, and the original cast recording won a Grammy Award. Brown was a recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. In 2017, Brown was inducted into National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame."

He first received attention after earning the Volpi Cup for his performance in the film \"Maurice\" (1987) but achieved international success after appearing in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994). He used this breakthrough role as a frequent cinematic persona during the 1990s, delivering comic performances in films such as \"Notting Hill\" (1999) and \"Mickey Blue Eyes\" (1999). For \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", Grant won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. One of the best known figures in 1990s British popular culture, Grant was then in a high-profile relationship with Elizabeth Hurley, which was the focus of much attention in the British and international media. By the turn of the 21st century, Grant had established himself as a leading man, skilled with a satirical comic talent. He has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), \"About a Boy\" (2002), \"Love Actually\" (2003), and \"American Dreamz\" (2006).

Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms. The entertainment media's coverage of his life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. He has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, his disdain towards the culture of celebrity, and his hostility towards the media. He emerged as a prominent critic of the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation during the News International phone hacking scandal. In a career spanning more than 35 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling but rather a career that developed by happenstance.",

            "Hiram \"Hank\" Williams (September 17, 1923 \u2013 January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the \"Louisiana Hayride\" radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation \"for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\"",
            "\"Blue Love (In My Heart)\" is a song written by Fred Rose (credited under the pseudonym \"Floyd Jenkins\") and recorded by Hank Williams. It was released as a posthumous single by MGM Records in 1956. Williams recorded the song while living in Shreveport working the Louisiana Hayride in 1948 and 1949. It was one of his several Rose compositions he performed on the Johnny Fair Syrup radio show on KWKH in Shreveport. Rose produced Hank's records and published his songs through his company Acuff-Rose."

            "Diana Ross (born March 26, 1944) is an American singer, actress, and record producer. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Ross rose to fame as the lead singer of the vocal group the Supremes, which, during the 1960s, became Motown's most successful act, and are the best charting female group in US history, as well as one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. The group released a record-setting twelve number-one hit singles on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, including \"Where Did Our Love GoBaby LoveCome See About MeStop! In the Name of LoveYou Can't Hurry LoveYou Keep Me Hangin' OnLove Child\", and \"Someday We'll Be Together\". Following her departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross released her eponymous debut solo album that same year, featuring the number-one Pop hit \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". She later released the album \"Touch Me in the Morning\" in 1973; its title track reached number 1, as her second solo No. 1 hit. She continued a successful solo career through the 1970s, which included hit albums like \"Mahogany\" and \"Diana Ross\" and their number-one hit singles, \"Theme from Mahogany\" and \"Love Hangover\", respectively. Her 1980 album \"Diana\" produced another number-one single, \"Upside Down\", as well as the international hit \"I'm Coming Out\". Ross' final single with Motown during her initial run with the company achieved her sixth and final US number-one Pop hit, the duet \"Endless Love\" featuring Lionel Richie, whose solo career was launched with its success. Ross has also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe Award-winning and Academy Award\u2013nominated performance in the film Lady Sings the Blues (1972); she recorded its soundtrack, which became a number-one hit. She also starred in two other feature films, Mahogany (1975) and The Wiz (1978), later acting in the television films Out of Darkness (1994), for which she also was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and Double Platinum (1999). Ross is the only female artist to have number one singles as a solo artist; as the other half of a duet (Lionel Richie); as a member of a trio; and, as an ensemble member (We are the World-USA for Africa). In 1976, Ross was named the \"Female Entertainer of the Century\" by Billboard magazine. In 1993, the Guinness Book of World Records declared Ross the most successful female music artist in history, due to her success in the United States and United Kingdom for having more hits than any female artist in the charts, with a career total of 70 hit singles with her work with the Supremes and as a solo artist. Ross had a top 10 UK hit in every one of the last five decades, and sang lead on a top 75 hit single at least once every year from 1964 to 1996 in the UK, a period of 33 consecutive years and a record for any performer. In 1988, Ross was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes, alongside Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. She was the recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016. Ross is also one of the few recording artists to have two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\u2014one as a solo artist and the other as a member of the Supremes. In Billboard magazine's Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Artists chart, she ranked 16th as the lead singer of the Supremes and 26th as a solo artist."

Grandson of emperor Charlemagne and the third son of Louis the Pious, emperor of Francia, and his first wife, Ermengarde of Hesbaye, he received the appellation \"Germanicus\" shortly after his death in recognition of Magna Germania of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingian's assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the Roman Empire. After protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish Empire in the 843 Treaty of Verdun. His attempts to conquer the West Frankish Empire of his half-brother Charles the Bald in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the Treaty of Meerssen he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish Empire in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times."

He has written and edited for prominent Israeli media outlets including Maariv, Haaretz, Yedioth Ahronot, Globes, Israel Army Radio, Channel 2, and others. He also serves as a member of the directorate of the Israel Press Council. Tarchitsky was born in the town of Holon, to a family that immigrated from Argentine. He made his first steps as a journalist in the Haaretz website. Later he became a labor rights correspondent for the Jerusalem- based newspaper Kol Ha' Ir, and then a news editor for Maariv and Haaretz. In Haaretz he was one of the founders of the workers committee, which was one of the pioneer unionizing processes in the revival of the organized labor movement in Israel. When he left Haaretz he returned to Maariv, and established a social affairs section in the newspaper's website NRG. After leaving Maariv, Tarchitsky became a freelancer and worked with leading Israeli media outlets as a magazine writer and editor. While working in Haaretz, he became active in the Journalists Association in Tel Aviv and led a move to revive it. Following his efforts, the Association enlisted 400 young journalists as members. Tarchitsky was known for his critique of the Association and its dysfunction as a union. Increasingly frustrated with the Association's inabilities to overcome its structural flaws, he left it in late 2011 and established the Union of Journalists in Israel as part of the Histadrut, Israel's largest trade union. Since the founding of the Union of Journalists in 2012, Tarchitsky has served as its chairman. During his tenure more than 3,000 journalists have joined the union and he has unionized more than 25 media outlets, making journalism one of the most unionized sectors in the country. As chairman of the union he has led important moves to strengthen the status of journalists and freedom of press, including, among others, struggles against covert advertising, police and army violence towards journalists, political interference in public broadcasting and more. In July 2016, he was re-elected for an additional 4- year term as Chairman of the Union of Journalists in Israel."
