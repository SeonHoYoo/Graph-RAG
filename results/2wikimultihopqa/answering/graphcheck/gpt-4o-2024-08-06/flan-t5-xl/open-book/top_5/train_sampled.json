            "Slums of Berlin( German: Die Verrufenen) is a 1925 German silent drama film directed by Gerhard Lamprecht and starring Aud Egede- Nissen, Bernhard Goetzke and Mady Christians.",
            "Gerhard Lamprecht (6 October 1897 \u2013 4 May 1974) was a German film director, screenwriter and film historian. He directed 63 films between 1920 and 1958. He also wrote for 26 films between 1918 and 1958.",
            "Louis Marie Malle( 30 October 1932 \u2013 23 November 1995) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. His film\" Le Monde du silence\" won the Palme d' Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony; the award was instead presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of only four directors to have won the Golden Lion twice. Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film\" Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud\"( 1958), the World War II drama\" Lacombe, Lucien\"( 1974), the romantic crime film\" Atlantic City\"( 1980), the comedy- drama\" My Dinner with Andre\"( 1981), and the autobiographical film\" Au revoir les enfants\"( 1987).",
            "L' Inde fant\u00f4me: Reflexions sur un voyage is a 1969 French seven part television documentary miniseries about India, directed by Louis Malle. It was shown on BBC television as Phantom India. Malle later said that the film was his most personal work and the one he was most proud of, it is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his career. It was initially inspired by a two- month trip to India in late 1967 that Malle made on behalf of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to present a selection of\" new French cinema\" throughout the country. Filming took place between January 5, 1968, and May 1, 1968, with a crew of two, a cameraman and a sound recordist. Malle arrived in India with no particular plans and financed the trip himself. The resulting 30 hours of footage was then edited down to the 363 minutes of\" Phantom India\". The 105- minute- long\" Calcutta\" used the footage he had recorded over his three- week stay in that city. \" Phantom India\" was shown on French television and the BBC in the UK in 1969. Many British Indians and the Indian Government felt that Malle had shown a one- sided portrait of India, focussing on the impoverished, rather than the developing, parts of the country. A diplomatic incident occurred when the Indian government asked the BBC to stop broadcasting the programme. The BBC refused and were briefly asked to leave their New Delhi bureau."

Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The Famous Flames. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with the discovery of James Brown. He also claims responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.",

            "Louis XVIII (Louis Stanislas Xavier; 17 November 1755 \u2013 16 September 1824), known as \"the Desired\" (le D\u00e9sir\u00e9), was King of France from 1814 to 1824, except for a period in 1815 known as the Hundred Days. He spent twenty-three years in exile, from 1791 to 1814, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, and again in 1815, during the period of the Hundred Days, upon the return of Napoleon I from Elba. Until his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence succeeded as (titular) king Louis XVIII. Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, England, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored his French Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne. Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while still reigning, as Charles X (1824\u20131830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830\u20131848) and Napoleon III (1852\u20131870) were deposed.",
            "Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy (2 September 1753 \u2013 13 November 1810) was a Princess of France and Countess of Provence by marriage to the future King Louis XVIII of France. She was, in the opinion of Bourbon Royalists Legitimists, regarded as titular 'Queen of France' when her husband assumed the title of King in 1795 upon the death of his nephew, the titular King Louis XVII of France, until her death. In reality she never had this title, as she died before her husband actually became King in 1814."

In 1952, she was elevated to the office of Hand of the Cause of God, for which she attended to issues related to the expansion and protection of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and served an important role in the transfer of authority from 1957 to 1963. R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed was raised in Montreal, Quebec. After two trips to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed holy land in Haifa, Israel, she engaged in many youth activities in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. She married Shoghi Effendi in 1937. After his death, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed became for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds the last remaining link to the family of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, who headed the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1892 to 1921 and was the eldest son of the faith's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. In 2004, CBC viewers voted her number 44 on the list of \"greatest Canadians\" on the television show \"The Greatest Canadian\". She was also a noted speaker from her teens and lectured frequently on the impacts of racism and prejudice. A prolific writer since her youth, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was the author of several published books, such as \"Prescription for Living\" and \"The Priceless Pearl\". R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was heavily involved in ecology and environmental issues, being a co-founder of the organization Alliance of Religions and Conservation, which is an interfaith organization aimed at assisting the major religions of the world to develop environmental programs based on their own core teachings, beliefs and practices.",
            "Shogh\u00ed Effend\u00ed Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed (1 March 1897 \u2013 4 November 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi , was the Guardian and appointed head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957. Shoghi Effendi spent his early life in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre). His education was directed to serving as secretary and translator to his grandfather, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then leader of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and son of the religion's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. After the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, the leadership of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the \"Guardian\", and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had been declared Covenant-breakers by either \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without appointing a successor Guardian, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith."

            "Joseph Frederick Traub (June 24, 1932 \u2013 August 24, 2015) was an American computer scientist. He was the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He held positions at Bell Laboratories, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia, as well as sabbatical positions at Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, California Institute of Technology, and Technical University, Munich. Traub was the author or editor of ten monographs and some 120 papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, finance, and economics. In 1959 he began his work on optimal iteration theory culminating in his 1964 monograph, which is still in print. Subsequently he pioneered work with Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski on computational complexity applied to continuous scientific problems (information-based complexity). He collaborated in creating significant new algorithms including the Jenkins-Traub Algorithm for Polynomial Zeros, as well as the Kung-Traub, Shaw-Traub, and Brent-Traub algorithms. One of his research areas was continuous quantum computing. As of November 10, 2015, his works have been cited 8500 times, and he has an h-index of 35. From 1971 to 1979 he headed the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon and led it from a critical period to eminence (see Joseph Traub digital archive at Carnegie Mellon). From 1979 to 1989 he was the founding Chair of the Computer Science Department at Columbia. From 1986 to 1992 he served as founding Chair of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Academies and held the post again 2005\u20132009. Traub was founding Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Complexity, in 1985 until his death in 2015. Both his research and institution building work have had a major impact on the field of computer science.",

            "Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150million records worldwide. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \" Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, \"September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy-winning television special . After releasing \"Sinatra at the Sands\", recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\". It was followed by 1968's \"Francis A. & Edward K.\" with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for \"From Here to Eternity\", he starred in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"High Society\" (1956), and \"Pal Joey\" (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in \"Tony Rome\" (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. In crime, Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation After Sinatra's death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.",
            "\"Witchcraft\" is a popular song from 1957 composed by Cy Coleman with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh. It was released as a single by Frank Sinatra, and reached number six in the U.S., spending sixteen weeks on the charts. Elvis Presley sang this song in ."

            "Felix Muskett Morley (January 6, 1894 \u2013 March 13, 1982) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and college administrator from the United States.",
            "William Somerville Shanks ARSA, RSA, RSW (28 September 1864 \u2013 28 July 1951) was a Scottish artist who was a tutor in painting and drawing at the Glasgow School of Art for 29 years. His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" sold for \u00a3181,250 at Sotheby's in 2008, a record for the artist. William Somerville Shanks was born in Gourock in Renfrewshire in 1864 to Helen and John Shanks (1923-1913), a horse proprietor who worked as a clothier and tailor in his native town of Paisley where generations of his family had been weavers. According to the 1871 census they were living at 1, George Place in Gourock with their four children: Mary, William, Agnes and Archibald. The 1881 census reveals that by then the family were living in Glasgow where William Somerville Shanks was working as a pattern designer for a curtain manufacturer. However, William Shanks had ambitions to be an artist, and after attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art under Francis Henry Newbery he made painting his career, in 1889 travelling to Paris to improve his skills, studying for three years at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. In Paris Shanks became influenced by the paintings of Edouard Manet. His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1897 and at one time was owned by Eliot Hodgkin who sold it to art dealer Charlotte Frank, the aunt of Anne Frank; Sir David Montagu Douglas Scott obtained it from her in 1962 for \u00a360. On loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 2007 to 2008, it sold at Sotheby's in 2008 for \u00a3181,250, a record for the artist. Shanks was to become a regular exhibitor at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy. Later Shanks was to return to the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) as a tutor of painting and drawing, remaining there for the next 29 years. A painter in oil and watercolours of portraits, interiors and still life but who preferred to work in oils, at the GSA Shanks was Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Antique and preparatory life 1910 to 1911; Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Life, head life, portrait and costume model, painting, antique and still life 1913 to 1914 and 1924 to 1925; Lecturer (Drawing and Painting) Drawing, painting and composition 1925 to 1926 and 1929 to 1930; Drawing and Painting (School of Design, Pictorial and Commercial Art) 1930 to 1931; Drawing and Painting (Drawing and Painting) 1934 to 1935. In 1922 he received a silver medal at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. Although not a member of the Glasgow Boys Shanks was clearly influenced by their work and would have known Edward Atkinson Hornel and George Henry. Shanks was elected an Associate (ARSA) of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1923 and elected Member of the RSA in 1933. Shanks lived at 8 Parkgrove Terrace in Glasgow. A self portrait (see above) is held in the Collection of National Galleries of Scotland."

            "When a Stranger Calls is a 1979 American psychological horror film written and directed by Fred Walton and co-written by Steve Feke. It stars Carol Kane, Colleen Dewhurst, Tony Beckley and Charles Durning. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of\" the babysitter and the man upstairs\". The film has developed a large cult following over time because of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest openings in movie history. The opening sequence was highly influential for the horror genre and was paid homage to in Wes Craven's\" Scream\" in the latter film's opening 12 minutes. \" When a Stranger Calls\" was released in the United States on October 26, 1979, by Columbia Pictures. The film was commercially successful, grossing$ 21,411,158 at the box office, though it received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was followed by the 1993 made- for- cable sequel\" When a Stranger Calls Back\" and a remake in 2006.",

            "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\". John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over \u00a3300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a \"melodic genius\" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.",
            "\"Runaway Train\" is a pop rock song recorded by the British rock-pop musicians Elton John and Eric Clapton. A CD, cassette and 7\" vinyl single from Elton John's album \" The One\" was released in July 1992 which was later also accompanied by a music video shot the same year. It was also used in the \"Lethal Weapon 3\" movie soundtrack."

Grell's oeuvre includes three symphonies, three string quartets, and large amounts of vocal music. He is considered one of the leaders of the Palestrina renaissance in Europe.

            "Abisin Abbas (26 February 1902 \u2013 20 October 1961), better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara , was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies. Born in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, he first worked as a reporter in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play \"Dr Samsi\". After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, \"Noesa Penida\" (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.",
            "Gadis Desa (literally \"Maiden from the Village\") is a 1949 comedy from what is now Indonesia written and directed by Andjar Asmara. Starring Basuki Djaelani, Ratna Ruthinah, Ali Joego, and Djauhari Effendi, it follows the romantic hijinks of a village girl who is taken to be a rich man's second wife.

            "Attack Force Z (alternatively titled The Z Men) is a 1982 Australian-Taiwanese World War II film directed by Tim Burstall. It is loosely based on actual events and was filmed in Taiwan in 1979. It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 1981. The film is noted for starring Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite Z Special Unit against the Empire of Japan during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit. Its main brief was to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage missions throughout Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.",
            "Timothy Burstall AM (20 April 1927 \u2013 19 April 2004) was an English Australian film director, writer and producer, best known for hit Australian movie \"Alvin Purple\" (1973) and its sequel \"Alvin Rides Again\". A key figure in Australian postwar cinema , Burstall was instrumental in rebuilding the Australian film industry at a time when it had been effectively dead for over a decade. He created groundbreaking Australian films including \"StorkEnd PlayEliza FraserThe Last of the Knucklemen\" and the 1987 adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel \"Kangaroo\". Burstall's films featured early appearances by many legendary Australian actors including Jack Thompson, Bruce Spence, Jacki Weaver, \"Alvin\" star Graeme Blundell, John Waters and Judy Davis. Burstall's wife, Betty Burstall, an important figure in her own right, founded the pioneering La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in the late 1960s, with which Tim was involved. Speaking just after Burstall's death, David Williamson said that Burstall \"couldn't stomach\" Australia's lack of a film industry. \" He was determined to do something about it and he had the energy and spirit to do it. (He) was a very important cultural figure: highly intelligent, widely read, with a succinct and often highly controversial opinion on everything.\""

            "Don Juan is a 1955 Austrian musical film directed by Walter Kolm-Velt\u00e9e and starring Cesare Danova, Josef Meinrad and Evelyn Cormand. It is an adaptation of the Mozart opera \"Don Giovanni\". The film was shot in the Soviet-controlled Rosenh\u00fcgel Studios in Vienna.",
            "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 \u2013 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized. He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\"."

            "Michael Findlay (August 27, 1937 \u2013 May 16, 1977) was an American filmmaker, producer and screenwriter. Along with his wife Roberta, Findlay created numerous low-budget Z movies in the 1960s and 1970s. They have been described as \"the most notorious filmmakers in the annals of sexploitation\". In the mid-to-late 1960s, Findlay was prominent among a small group of underground New York filmmakers (including Joseph W. Sarno, Joseph P. Mawra, and Lou Campa) that produced exploitation \"roughies\" (early slasher films which combined conventional horror or thriller stories with sadomasochistic sex scenes) for the grindhouse market. Sometimes he would direct under the alias Julian Marsh and act in his own films billed as Robert West. His wife Roberta (a.k.a. Anna Riva) was the cinematographer, co-writer, and supporting actress for many of their films together. They also employed the same actors repeatedly, most notably Uta Erickson, and Marie Brent, a.k.a. Janet Banzet. The Findlays were friends with George Weiss, producer of Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda\" and a series of fetishistic \"Olga\" films (\"Olga's House of ShameOlga's Girls\", et al.) . In 1964 Weiss encouraged them to make films in this new subgenre of violent sexploitation.",
            "Roberta Findlay (born 1948) is an American film director, cinematographer, producer and actress. She is best known for her work in the exploitation field. Her work has received increasing critical appreciation in recent years. She was married to Michael Findlay and they made a number of films together. After his death she continued to make movies."

            "Geoffrey Chaucer (\u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages, he is best known for \"The Canterbury Tales\". Chaucer has been styled the \"Father of English literature\". He was the first writer buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific \"A Treatise on the Astrolabe\" for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat, and member of parliament. Among Chaucer's many other works are \"The Book of the DuchessThe House of FameThe Legend of Good Women\", and \"Troilus and Criseyde\". He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of the Middle English vernacular when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin.",

            "Marvin Gaye (born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.; April 2, 1939 \u2013 April 1, 1984) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, earning him the nicknames \"Prince of Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\". Gaye's Motown hits include \"Ain't That PeculiarHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", and duet recordings with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Diana Ross, and Tammi Terrell. During the 1970s, he recorded the albums \" What's Going On\" and \"Let's Get It On\" and became one of the first artists in Motown, along with Stevie Wonder, to break away from the reins of a production company. His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. Following a period in Europe as a tax exile in the early 1980s, he released the 1982 hit \"Sexual Healing\", which won him his first two Grammy Awards, and its parent album \"Midnight Love\". Gaye's last television appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and on \"Soul Train\" which was his third and final appearance. On April 1, 1984, the day before his 45th birthday, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards and other honors including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
            "\"Midnight Lady\" is the first track on Marvin Gaye's 1982 album, \"Midnight Love\". It contains sly references to Rick James and his hit, \"Super Freak\"."

            "George Brackett Seitz (January 3, 1888 \u2013 July 8, 1944) was an American playwright, screenwriter, film actor and director. He was known for his screenplays for action serials, such as \"The Perils of Pauline\" (1914) and \"The Exploits of Elaine\" (1914). Seitz was born in Boston, Massachusetts, started his career as a playwright, and also wrote some fiction for \"up-market\" pulp magazines such as \"Adventure\" and \"People's Magazine\". Seitz did much of his early work in Fort Lee, New Jersey when many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based there. He was the director of more than one hundred films, the writer of more than thirty screenplays, and an actor in seven films. He worked at Columbia Pictures and at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer where he directed eleven films in the \"Andy Hardy\" series of the 1930s & 1940s. He died in Hollywood, California in 1944. Although an acquaintance of the cinematographer John F. Seitz, they were not related. He was the father of George B. Seitz Jr., who was a writer/director active in the 1940s and 1950s in films and television."

            "Flying High is a 1926 American silent action film directed by Charles Hutchison and starring William Fairbanks, Alice Calhoun and Frank Rice.",
            "Charles Hutchison (December 3, 1879 \u2013 May 30, 1949) was an American film actor, director and screenwriter. He appeared in 49 films between 1914 and 1944. He also directed 33 films between 1915 and 1938. Though he directed numerous independent silent features, he is best remembered today as Path\u00e9's leading male serial star from 1918 to 1922. In 1923 he went to Britain and made two films \" Hutch Stirs 'em Up\" and \"Hurricane Hutch in Many Adventures\" for the Ideal Film Company. He made one last serial in 1926, \"Lightning Hutch\", for Arrow Film Company. It was meant to be a comeback vehicle, but the production company went into bankruptcy just as it was released. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and died in Hollywood, California. He was the person who convinced actor Karl Dane to return to films in the mid-1920s."

            "\"Too Darn Hot\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948). In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company. In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions (according to general opinion); in the stage version, the song represents the company of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allowed the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line ' According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to ' According to the latest report'. The song has also been covered by many artists.",
            "Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 \u2013 October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Many of his songs became standards noted for their witty, urbane lyrics, and many of his scores found success on Broadway and in film. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, Porter defied his grandfather's wishes and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn to musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike many successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote the lyrics as well as the music for his songs. After a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work. His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and '30s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, \"Kiss Me, Kate\". It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter's other musicals include \"Fifty Million FrenchmenDuBarry Was a LadyAnything GoesCan -Can\" and \"Silk Stockings\". His numerous hit songs include \"Night and DayBegin the BeguineI Get a Kick Out of YouWell , Did You Evah!I've Got You Under My SkinMy Heart Belongs to Daddy\" and \"You're the Top\". He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including \"Born to Dance\" (1936), which featured the song \" You'd Be So Easy to LoveRosalie\" (1937), which featured \"In the Still of the NightHigh Society\" (1956), which included \"True Love\"; and \"Les Girls\" (1957)."

            "Rosemarie Springer (also Rosemarie Alsen, n\u00e9e Lorenz; July 5, 1920 \u2013 April 2, 2019) was a German equestrian. Born in Danzig, she was the daughter of Werner Lorenz, who would later become an SS member and head of the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle in Nazi Germany. She first rode a horse at the age of two, sitting on her father's lap, and took up equestrianism at a young age. Her career was interrupted by World War II, however, and she served as a nurse during the conflict. She did not resume riding until 1950 but, soon after, her talents were spotted at a Berlin horse show. Among other international appearances, she participated in the individual dressage event at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where she finished seventh in a field of seventeen competitors. She retired from active competition in the late 1970s, having been the German national champion in women's dressage seven times. Following her competitive career, Springer took up judging and training, the latter of which occupied her time until at least 2012. In her late 80s she continued to ski twice a year and occasionally ride in informal tournaments in Germany. She married cement manufacturer Horst-Herbert Alsen in 1941 and divorced him in 1953 to marry Alsen's friend, journalist Axel Springer. This union lasted until 1961 when Springer left her to marry Helga Ludewig. On her 75th birthday, Springer was honored by the German Equestrian Federation (FN) for her contributions to the sport. She died on April 2, 2019 at the age of 98.",
            "Werner Lorenz (October 2, 1891 \u2013 March 13, 1974) was an SS functionary during the Nazi era. He was head of the \"Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle\" (VOMI) (Main Office for Ethnic Germans), an organization charged with resettling ethnic Germans in the \"German Reich\" from other parts of Europe, as well as colonising the occupied lands during World War II. After the war, Lorenz was sentenced to prison for crimes against humanity in 1948. He was released in 1955 and died in 1974."

            "\"Me and My Arrow\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson for his 1970 album \"The Point!\". It was also released as a single in 1971, reaching number 34 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number three on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song was composed as the theme for Oblio, the pointless boy, and his dog, Arrow. Although the song may be a reference to taking a direction and suddenly not knowing where to go, it is in fact about the friendship between Oblio and the dog. It is also a parable for discrimination.",
            "Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 \u2013 January 15, 1994), known mononymously as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who achieved the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a 3\u00bd octave range , Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours. The craft of his songs and the defiant attitude he projected remains a touchstone for later generations of indie rock musicians. Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family's poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing, and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP \"Pandemonium Shadow Show\", followed by a variety of releases that include a collaboration with Randy Newman (\"Nilsson Sings Newman\", 1970) and the original children's story \"The Point!\" (1971). His most commercially successful album, \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" (1971), produced the international top 10 singles \"Without You\" and \"Coconut\". His other top 10 hit, \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1968), was a prominent song in the 1969 film \"Midnight Cowboy\". A version of Nilsson's \"One\", released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.\nDuring a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered \"Nilsson\". He soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. In the 1970s, Nilsson and Lennon joined Starr as members of the Hollywood Vampires drinking club, embroiling themselves in a number of widely publicized, alcohol-fueled incidents. At the same time, they produced one collaborative album, \"Pussy Cats\" (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon's 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. Nilsson created the first remix album (\"Aerial Pandemonium Ballet\", 1971) and recorded the first mashup song (\"You Can't Do That\", 1967). He was voted No. 62 in \"Rolling Stone\"s 2015 list of the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\", where he was described as \"a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound, a crucial bridge between the baroque psychedelic pop of the late Sixties and the more personal singer-songwriter era of the Seventies\". The RIAA certified \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" and \"Son of Schmilsson\" as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. His honors include Grammy Awards for two of his recordings; Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male in 1970 for \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male in 1973 for \"Without You\". In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, \"Losst and Founnd\" (2019)."

            "Axel Julius de la Gardie (1637\u20131710) was a Swedish Field Marshal and was appointed Governor-General over Estonia. Axel Julius was the son of military commander Jacob De la Gardie and Ebba Brahe. He became colonel of an infantry regiment and a cavalry regiment and in 1684 he attained the rank of major general in the cavalry, and was a colonel in the Royal Guard. In 1668 he became lieutenant general and finally, later, Field Marshal. Upon the threat of war with Russia, he received orders to command the troops in Finland and Ingria and take necessary defensive actions. At the \"landtag\" he held in 1676 in \u00c5bo, the government granted the request of new war efforts. He married Sofia Juliana Arvidsdotter Forbus in 1664",
            "Field Marshal and Count Jacob Pontusson De la Gardie (Reval, 20 June 1583 \u2013 Stockholm, 22 August 1652) was a statesman and a soldier of the Swedish Empire, and a Marshal from 1620 onward. He was Privy Councilor from 1613 onward, Governor of Swedish Estonia in 1619\u20131622, Governor-General of Livonia in 1622\u20131628 (conquered by the Swedish Empire in 1621, and referred to as Swedish Livonia in 1629\u20131721), and Lord High Constable from 1620. He introduced reforms based on the then novel Dutch military doctrine into the Swedish army. He commanded the Swedish forces in Russia and against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He also served as one of the five regents jointly ruling Sweden during the minority of Queen Christina."

            "Fatherland (released as Singing the Blues in Red in the US) is a 1986 film about a German singer-songwriter, directed by Ken Loach and starring , , Cristine Rose and Sigfrit Steiner. The film is one of Loach's least-popular films, being referred to as \"a heavy-handed and absurd political drama\" in MIT's newspaper \"The Tech\" and Loach said in a 2016 Guardian interview that he \"made a mess\" of the film. As the film was partly in German, its audience was limited in English-speaking countries, where foreign-language films were uncommon in the 1980s. Between its cinematic release and the 2013 DVD release, the film was rare.",
            "Kenneth Charles Loach (born 17 June 1936) is an English filmmaker. His socially critical directing style and socialist ideals are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty (\"Poor Cow\", 1967), homelessness (\"Cathy Come Home\", 1966), and labour rights (\"Riff-Raff\", 1991, and \"The Navigators\", 2001). Loach's film \"Kes\" (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\" (2006) and \"I, Daniel Blake\" (2016), received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the ninth filmmaker to win the award twice. Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK are \"a , \"Catch-22\" situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\"."

            "Robert Florey( 14 September 1900 \u2013 16 May 1979) was a French- American director, screenwriter, film journalist and actor. Born as Robert Fuchs in Paris, he became an orphan at an early age and was then raised in Switzerland. In 1920 he worked at first as a film journalist, then as an assistant and extra in featurettes from Louis Feuillade. Florey moved to the United States in 1921. As a director, Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low- budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant- garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio- system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939's\" Hotel Imperial\". He directed more than 50 movies. His most popular film is likely the first Marx Brothers feature\" The Cocoanuts\" of 1929, and his 1932 foray into Universal- style horror,\" Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film\" Daughter of Shanghai\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called\" widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films\".",
            "Reservation Road is a 2007 American drama film directed by Terry George and based on the book of the same title by John Burnham Schwartz, who, along with George, adapted the novel for the screenplay. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo, deals with the aftermath of a fatal car crash. It was released to theaters on October 19, 2007.",
            "The Magnificent Fraud is a 1939 American crime film directed by Robert Florey and starring Akim Tamiroff, Lloyd Nolan, Mary Boland and Patricia Morison.",
            "Terence George( born 20 December 1952) is an Irish screenwriter and director. Much of his film work( e.g.\" The BoxerSome Mother's Son\", and\" In the Name of the Father\") involves\" The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. He was nominated for two Oscars: Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium( 1993;\" In the Name of the Father\"), and Best Writing, Original Screenplay( 2004;\" Hotel Rwanda\"). On 26 February 2012, he received an Oscar in the live action short film category for\" The Shore\"."

He was known for his investigative journalism and reporting on crime, including the Ju\u00e1rez murders, and his death was acknowledged by the Board of the Investigative Reporters & Editors in an official statement that condemned his murder.",
            "Teddy Weatherford (October 11, 1903 \u2212 April 25, 1945) was an American jazz pianist and an accomplished stride pianist. Weatherford was born in Pocahontas, Virginia and was raised in neighboring Bluefield, West Virginia. From 1915 through 1920, he lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he learned to play jazz piano. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he worked with such bands as that of Erskine Tate through the 1920s and with such jazz notables as Louis Armstrong and Johnny Dodds and impressed the young Earl Hines. Weatherford then traveled, first to Amsterdam, then around Asia playing professionally. In the early 1930s, he led a band at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He joined Crickett Smith's band in Jakarta, Indonesia. Weatherford took over leadership of Smith's band in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1937. During World War II, he led a band in Calcutta, where he made radio broadcasts for the U. S. Armed Forces Radio Service. Performers with Weatherford's band included Bridget Althea Moe, Jimmy Witherspoon, Roy Butler and Gery Scott. Teddy Weatherford died of cholera in Calcutta, aged 41."

            "While London Sleeps is a 1926 Warner Bros. film about a police-dog, Rinty, who helps Scotland Yard defeat a dangerous criminal organisation known as the Mediterranean Brotherhood that operates out of the Limehouse district of London. Walter Morosco wrote the screenplay. It was the first of many films directed by Howard Bretherton, and one of several created for Rin Tin Tin, a German Shepherd dog used in films during the 1920s and 1930s. The film was also released with a Vitaphone sound-on-disc soundtrack with a music score and sound effects, and only the sound discs survive today. The British release prints censored the more horrific aspects of the film. George Kotsonaros only appeared in two horror films, this one and \"The Wizard\" (1927), and he played a beast-man in both movies. He died in a car accident in Alabama in 1933.",
            "Howard Bretherton (13 February 1890, Tacoma, Washington \u2013 12 April 1969, San Diego, California) was an American film director, film editor, and the father of film editor David Bretherton."

            "Give Us Our Skeletons! (Antakaa Meille Luurankomme in Finnish, Oaivveskaldjut in North Sami) is a 1999 documentary film directed by Paul-Anders Simma about Niillas Somby, a Sami man who retraces his family ancestry as he searches for the head of his ancestor, Mons Somby. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jakobsen H\u00e6tta were executed by decapitation on 14 October 1854 for murder, following the 1852 Kautokeino rebellion against the local Norwegian government in which two people were murdered. Their heads were claimed by the government for scientific research, and were held as part of a collection of 900 skulls at the Anatomical Institute, in Oslo. The movie describes three parallel plots; the first is Niillas Somby's story on how he became one of the most celebrated protesters during the Alta Dam Protests between 1979-1981 near Kautokeino, Norway. In the years that followed, he traveled in exile to Canada where he was given sanctuary by the Iroquois First Nation, and later returned to Norway. The second plot was the disturbing examination of the scientific racism and racial classification movement that was considered an accepted fact by Scandinavian scientists from the early 19th century until the 1950s. This included the plundering of Sami graves for their skeletons and the forced sterilization of the Sami and other peoples in Scandinavia who were viewed as competing with the \"noble races\", as part of a larger eugenics program. The third and final plot was Niillas Somby's emotional struggle with bringing Mons Somby's skull home for a proper burial.",
            "Lloyd Francis Bacon (December 4, 1889 \u2013 November 15, 1955) was an American screen, stage and vaudeville actor and film director. As a director he made films in virtually all genres, including westerns, musicals, comedies, gangster films, and crime dramas. He was one of the directors at Warner Bros. in the 1930s who helped give that studio its reputation for gritty, fast-paced \"torn from the headlines\" action films. And, in directing Warner Bros.' \"42nd Street\", he joined the movie's song-and-dance-number director, Busby Berkeley, in contributing to \"an instant and enduring classic [that] transformed the musical genre.\"",

            "141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence is a 1975 Hungarian drama film directed by Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri. It was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival where F\u00e1bri won a Special Prize for Directing.",
            "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri( 15 October 1917 \u2013 23 August 1994) was a Hungarian film director and screenwriter. His films\" The Boys of Paul Street\"( 1969) and\" Hungarians\"( 1978) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His 1965 film\" Twenty Hours\" shared the Grand Prix with\" War and Peace\" at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1969 film\" The Toth Family\" was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1975 film\" 141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence\" was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, where he won a Special Prize for Directing. F\u00e1bri wanted to become an artist from an early age on. He studied painting and graduated at the Hungarian College of Fine Arts. He began working in the Hungarian film industry in 1950 as a production designer. He directed his first film\" ViharStorm\") in 1951. He became an internationally acclaimed director with his third feature\" K\u00f6rhintaMerry Go- Round\") in 1956. He continued directing and writing until the early 1980s. After his retirement from the film industry F\u00e1bri taught on the Hungarian University of Theatrical and Film Arts. In his last years he wrote screenplays; they were never made. F\u00e1bri was also the president of the Hungarian Film Artist Union from 1959 to 1981. F\u00e1bri's style of filmmaking can be described mainly as\" classical\", using academic techniques of art filmmaking. His greatest influences were the Italian Neorealism and French Poetic Realism. He experimented with narrative and flashback techniques for a while in the 1960s( in his films\" Nappali s\u00f6t\u00e9ts\u00e9g\" and\" H\u00fasz \u00f3ra\") and his 1976 film\" Az \u00f6t\u00f6dik pecs\u00e9t\" contains some highly surrealist scenes, but overall he never used the mannerisms of modernist film in his works. For this reason the K\u00e1d\u00e1r regime favored F\u00e1bri over more controversial and experimental directors like Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3. The film won the Golden Prize at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. He was known as a perfectionist who wrote, drawn and choreographed every scene to the most precise detail months before production began and never improvised anything. His reputation as a rigid, tyrannical director was somewhat contradicted by his friendly and kind behaviour towards the British and American child actors on the set of\" The Boys of Paul Street\". F\u00e1bri made nearly all of his films based on literary material( novels or short stories) and wrote the screenplays himself. His constant theme was the question of humanity. Many of his films are set in or around World War II. Two of his frequent collaborators were actress Mari T\u00f6r\u0151csik and cinematographer Gy\u00f6rgy Ill\u00e9s. In 1969 he played the role of prosecuted statesman Zolt\u00e1n D\u00e1niel in his friend P\u00e9ter Bacs\u00f3's cult satire,\" A tan \u00fa The Witness\") as his sole acting job. F\u00e1bri died in a heart attack at the age of 76 in 1994. His legal successor is Peter Fabri( b. 1985).",
            "Harry Beaumont( February 10, 1888 \u2013 December 22, 1966) was an American film director, actor, and screenwriter. He worked for a variety of production companies including Fox, Goldwyn, Metro, Warner Brothers, and Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer."

            "Jacques Jaccard( September 11, 1886 \u2013 July 24, 1960) was an American film director, writer and actor whose achievements in cinema were mostly in silent film. Jaccard was born in New York City. He directed 86 films and wrote the scripts for almost 80 films. The best- known of his films as a director was\" The Diamond from the Sky\"( 1915). Jaccard began his movie career in 1913 as an actor. While working as an actor, he also worked as an assistant director. He began working for Universal Pictures and specialized in western and action films. In the mid-1920s he began working for lower- rent studios such as Goodwill Pictures, Syndicate Pictures and Arrow Pictures. When movies with sound became popular, Jaccard's career went downhill until he directed his last film, Se\u00f1or Jim, in 1936. After that he worked as a screenwriter and dialogue director. In 1940 he rejoined Universal's serial department as a dialogue coach, working on such popular serials as\" Gang Busters\" and\" Adventures of the Flying Cadets\". Jaccard retired in 1944 and died in Los Angeles, California, 1960.",
