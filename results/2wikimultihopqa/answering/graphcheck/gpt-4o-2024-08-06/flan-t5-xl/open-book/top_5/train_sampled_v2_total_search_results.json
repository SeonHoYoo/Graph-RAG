            "Slums of Berlin( German: Die Verrufenen) is a 1925 German silent drama film directed by Gerhard Lamprecht and starring Aud Egede- Nissen, Bernhard Goetzke and Mady Christians.",
            "Gerhard Lamprecht (6 October 1897 \u2013 4 May 1974) was a German film director, screenwriter and film historian. He directed 63 films between 1920 and 1958. He also wrote for 26 films between 1918 and 1958.",
            "Louis Marie Malle( 30 October 1932 \u2013 23 November 1995) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. His film\" Le Monde du silence\" won the Palme d' Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony; the award was instead presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of only four directors to have won the Golden Lion twice. Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film\" Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud\"( 1958), the World War II drama\" Lacombe, Lucien\"( 1974), the romantic crime film\" Atlantic City\"( 1980), the comedy- drama\" My Dinner with Andre\"( 1981), and the autobiographical film\" Au revoir les enfants\"( 1987).",
            "L' Inde fant\u00f4me: Reflexions sur un voyage is a 1969 French seven part television documentary miniseries about India, directed by Louis Malle. It was shown on BBC television as Phantom India. Malle later said that the film was his most personal work and the one he was most proud of, it is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his career. It was initially inspired by a two- month trip to India in late 1967 that Malle made on behalf of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to present a selection of\" new French cinema\" throughout the country. Filming took place between January 5, 1968, and May 1, 1968, with a crew of two, a cameraman and a sound recordist. Malle arrived in India with no particular plans and financed the trip himself. The resulting 30 hours of footage was then edited down to the 363 minutes of\" Phantom India\". The 105- minute- long\" Calcutta\" used the footage he had recorded over his three- week stay in that city. \" Phantom India\" was shown on French television and the BBC in the UK in 1969. Many British Indians and the Indian Government felt that Malle had shown a one- sided portrait of India, focussing on the impoverished, rather than the developing, parts of the country. A diplomatic incident occurred when the Indian government asked the BBC to stop broadcasting the programme. The BBC refused and were briefly asked to leave their New Delhi bureau."

Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The Famous Flames. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with the discovery of James Brown. He also claims responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.",

            "Louis XVIII (Louis Stanislas Xavier; 17 November 1755 \u2013 16 September 1824), known as \"the Desired\" (le D\u00e9sir\u00e9), was King of France from 1814 to 1824, except for a period in 1815 known as the Hundred Days. He spent twenty-three years in exile, from 1791 to 1814, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, and again in 1815, during the period of the Hundred Days, upon the return of Napoleon I from Elba. Until his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence succeeded as (titular) king Louis XVIII. Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, England, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored his French Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne. Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while still reigning, as Charles X (1824\u20131830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830\u20131848) and Napoleon III (1852\u20131870) were deposed.",

In reality she never had this title, as she died before her husband actually became King in 1814."

It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to nationalism and national identity.

It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to nationalism and national identity. Renan wrote \"\"What is a Nation\"\" in order to symbolize the nationalism which was born in France as a result of the French Revolution of 1789. Renan begins his essay by noting\nDoc 2(Title: What Is a Nation?) to the reasons based on race, geography, history and so on.

It is frequently quoted or anthologized in works of history or political science pertaining to nationalism and national identity. Renan wrote \"\"What is a Nation\"\" in order to symbolize the nationalism which was born in France as a result of the French Revolution of 1789. Renan begins his essay by noting\nDoc 2(Title: What Is a Nation?) to the reasons based on race, geography, history and so on. They argue that Renan maintains his intellectual background but subtly, i.e. the arguments he explicitly used in \"\"What is a Nation?\"\" are not consistent with his thinking. The concept of \"\"daily plebiscite\"\" would be ambiguous. They argue that the definition is an opportunist idealization and it should be interpreted within the Franco-Prussian War and in the midst of the dispute concerning the Alsace-Lorraine region.

In 1952, she was elevated to the office of Hand of the Cause of God, for which she attended to issues related to the expansion and protection of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and served an important role in the transfer of authority from 1957 to 1963. R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed was raised in Montreal, Quebec. After two trips to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed holy land in Haifa, Israel, she engaged in many youth activities in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. She married Shoghi Effendi in 1937. After his death, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed became for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds the last remaining link to the family of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, who headed the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1892 to 1921 and was the eldest son of the faith's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. In 2004, CBC viewers voted her number 44 on the list of \"greatest Canadians\" on the television show \"The Greatest Canadian\". She was also a noted speaker from her teens and lectured frequently on the impacts of racism and prejudice. A prolific writer since her youth, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was the author of several published books, such as \"Prescription for Living\" and \"The Priceless Pearl\". R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was heavily involved in ecology and environmental issues, being a co-founder of the organization Alliance of Religions and Conservation, which is an interfaith organization aimed at assisting the major religions of the world to develop environmental programs based on their own core teachings, beliefs and practices.",
            "Shogh\u00ed Effend\u00ed Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed (1 March 1897 \u2013 4 November 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi , was the Guardian and appointed head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957. Shoghi Effendi spent his early life in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre). His education was directed to serving as secretary and translator to his grandfather, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then leader of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and son of the religion's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. After the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, the leadership of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the \"Guardian\", and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had been declared Covenant-breakers by either \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without appointing a successor Guardian, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith."

The most commonly applied coatings are based upon liquid paints, although films (also known as laminates) and powder coatings are used in smaller quantities. These are liquid paints (e.g. primers, finishes/backing coats, polyesters, plastisols, polyurethanes, polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDF), epoxies), powder coatings and laminate films.

The most commonly applied coatings are based upon liquid paints, although films (also known as laminates) and powder coatings are used in smaller quantities. These are liquid paints (e.g. primers, finishes/backing coats, polyesters, plastisols, polyurethanes, polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDF), epoxies), powder coatings and laminate films. Liquid paints account for more than 90% of the coatings used for prepainted metal. Films are often used where very high aesthetic quality is required.

The type of nozzle used will depend on the shape of the workpiece to be painted and the consistency of the paint. The object is then heated, and the powder melts into a uniform film, and is then cooled to form a hard coating. It is also common to heat the metal first and then spray the powder onto the hot substrate. Preheating can help to achieve a more uniform finish but can also create other problems, such as runs caused by excess powder.

            "Joseph Frederick Traub (June 24, 1932 \u2013 August 24, 2015) was an American computer scientist. He was the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He held positions at Bell Laboratories, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia, as well as sabbatical positions at Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, California Institute of Technology, and Technical University, Munich. Traub was the author or editor of ten monographs and some 120 papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, finance, and economics. In 1959 he began his work on optimal iteration theory culminating in his 1964 monograph, which is still in print. Subsequently he pioneered work with Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski on computational complexity applied to continuous scientific problems (information-based complexity). He collaborated in creating significant new algorithms including the Jenkins-Traub Algorithm for Polynomial Zeros, as well as the Kung-Traub, Shaw-Traub, and Brent-Traub algorithms. One of his research areas was continuous quantum computing. As of November 10, 2015, his works have been cited 8500 times, and he has an h-index of 35. From 1971 to 1979 he headed the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon and led it from a critical period to eminence (see Joseph Traub digital archive at Carnegie Mellon). From 1979 to 1989 he was the founding Chair of the Computer Science Department at Columbia. From 1986 to 1992 he served as founding Chair of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Academies and held the post again 2005\u20132009. Traub was founding Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Complexity, in 1985 until his death in 2015. Both his research and institution building work have had a major impact on the field of computer science.",

Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation. Simondon also conceived of \"\"pre-individual fields\"\" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a \"\"pre-individual\"\" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

            "Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150million records worldwide. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \" Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, \"September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy-winning television special . After releasing \"Sinatra at the Sands\", recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\". It was followed by 1968's \"Francis A. & Edward K.\" with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for \"From Here to Eternity\", he starred in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"High Society\" (1956), and \"Pal Joey\" (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in \"Tony Rome\" (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. In crime, Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation After Sinatra's death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.",
