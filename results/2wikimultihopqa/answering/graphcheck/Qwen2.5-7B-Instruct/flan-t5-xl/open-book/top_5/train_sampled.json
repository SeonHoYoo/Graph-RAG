            "Slums of Berlin( German: Die Verrufenen) is a 1925 German silent drama film directed by Gerhard Lamprecht and starring Aud Egede- Nissen, Bernhard Goetzke and Mady Christians.",
            "Gerhard Lamprecht (6 October 1897 \u2013 4 May 1974) was a German film director, screenwriter and film historian. He directed 63 films between 1920 and 1958. He also wrote for 26 films between 1918 and 1958.",
            "Louis Marie Malle( 30 October 1932 \u2013 23 November 1995) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. His film\" Le Monde du silence\" won the Palme d' Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, although he was not credited at the ceremony; the award was instead presented to the film's co-director Jacques Cousteau. Later in his career he was nominated multiple times for Academy Awards. Malle is also one of only four directors to have won the Golden Lion twice. Malle worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film\" Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud\"( 1958), the World War II drama\" Lacombe, Lucien\"( 1974), the romantic crime film\" Atlantic City\"( 1980), the comedy- drama\" My Dinner with Andre\"( 1981), and the autobiographical film\" Au revoir les enfants\"( 1987).",
            "L' Inde fant\u00f4me: Reflexions sur un voyage is a 1969 French seven part television documentary miniseries about India, directed by Louis Malle. It was shown on BBC television as Phantom India. Malle later said that the film was his most personal work and the one he was most proud of, it is widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his career. It was initially inspired by a two- month trip to India in late 1967 that Malle made on behalf of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to present a selection of\" new French cinema\" throughout the country. Filming took place between January 5, 1968, and May 1, 1968, with a crew of two, a cameraman and a sound recordist. Malle arrived in India with no particular plans and financed the trip himself. The resulting 30 hours of footage was then edited down to the 363 minutes of\" Phantom India\". The 105- minute- long\" Calcutta\" used the footage he had recorded over his three- week stay in that city. \" Phantom India\" was shown on French television and the BBC in the UK in 1969. Many British Indians and the Indian Government felt that Malle had shown a one- sided portrait of India, focussing on the impoverished, rather than the developing, parts of the country. A diplomatic incident occurred when the Indian government asked the BBC to stop broadcasting the programme. The BBC refused and were briefly asked to leave their New Delhi bureau."

            "Bobby Howard Byrd (August 15, 1934 \u2013 September 12, 2007) was an American R&B/soul singer, songwriter, bandleader, talent scout, record producer, and musician, who played an integral and important part in the development of soul and funk music in association with James Brown. Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The Famous Flames. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and is credited with the discovery of James Brown. He also claims responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.",

            "Louis XVIII (Louis Stanislas Xavier; 17 November 1755 \u2013 16 September 1824), known as \"the Desired\" (le D\u00e9sir\u00e9), was King of France from 1814 to 1824, except for a period in 1815 known as the Hundred Days. He spent twenty-three years in exile, from 1791 to 1814, during the French Revolution and the First French Empire, and again in 1815, during the period of the Hundred Days, upon the return of Napoleon I from Elba. Until his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence succeeded as (titular) king Louis XVIII. Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, England, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored his French Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne. Louis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while still reigning, as Charles X (1824\u20131830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830\u20131848) and Napoleon III (1852\u20131870) were deposed.",
            "Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy (2 September 1753 \u2013 13 November 1810) was a Princess of France and Countess of Provence by marriage to the future King Louis XVIII of France. She was, in the opinion of Bourbon Royalists Legitimists, regarded as titular 'Queen of France' when her husband assumed the title of King in 1795 upon the death of his nephew, the titular King Louis XVII of France, until her death. In reality she never had this title, as she died before her husband actually became King in 1814."

            "R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed (8 Aug 1910 \u2013 19 Jan 2000), born as Mary Sutherland Maxwell and best known by the title Amatu'l-Bah\u00e1 R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num, was the wife of Shoghi Effendi from 1937, the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith head of the religion 1921 to 1957. In 1952, she was elevated to the office of Hand of the Cause of God, for which she attended to issues related to the expansion and protection of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and served an important role in the transfer of authority from 1957 to 1963. R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed was raised in Montreal, Quebec. After two trips to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed holy land in Haifa, Israel, she engaged in many youth activities in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. She married Shoghi Effendi in 1937. After his death, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed became for Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds the last remaining link to the family of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, who headed the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1892 to 1921 and was the eldest son of the faith's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. In 2004, CBC viewers voted her number 44 on the list of \"greatest Canadians\" on the television show \"The Greatest Canadian\". She was also a noted speaker from her teens and lectured frequently on the impacts of racism and prejudice. A prolific writer since her youth, R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was the author of several published books, such as \"Prescription for Living\" and \"The Priceless Pearl\". R\u00fah\u00edyyih Kh\u00e1num was heavily involved in ecology and environmental issues, being a co-founder of the organization Alliance of Religions and Conservation, which is an interfaith organization aimed at assisting the major religions of the world to develop environmental programs based on their own core teachings, beliefs and practices.",
            "Shogh\u00ed Effend\u00ed Rabb\u00e1n\u00ed (1 March 1897 \u2013 4 November 1957), better known as Shoghi Effendi , was the Guardian and appointed head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith from 1921 until his death in 1957. Shoghi Effendi spent his early life in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre). His education was directed to serving as secretary and translator to his grandfather, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then leader of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and son of the religion's founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. After the death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1921, the leadership of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community changed from that of a single individual to an administrative order with executive and legislative branches, the head of each being the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, respectively. Shoghi Effendi was referred to as the \"Guardian\", and had the authority to interpret the writings of the three central figures of the religion and define the sphere of legislative authority. His writings are effectively limited to commentaries on the works of the central figures, and broad directives for the future. Future hereditary Guardians were permitted in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scripture by appointment from one to the next with the prerequisite that appointees be male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. At the time of Shoghi Effendi's death, all living male descendants of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had been declared Covenant-breakers by either \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 or Shoghi Effendi, leaving no suitable living candidates. Shoghi Effendi died without appointing a successor Guardian, and the Universal House of Justice, the only institution authorized to adjudicate on situations not covered in scripture, later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor to Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi was the first and last person acknowledged as Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith."

            "Joseph Frederick Traub (June 24, 1932 \u2013 August 24, 2015) was an American computer scientist. He was the Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute. He held positions at Bell Laboratories, University of Washington, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia, as well as sabbatical positions at Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, California Institute of Technology, and Technical University, Munich. Traub was the author or editor of ten monographs and some 120 papers in computer science, mathematics, physics, finance, and economics. In 1959 he began his work on optimal iteration theory culminating in his 1964 monograph, which is still in print. Subsequently he pioneered work with Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski on computational complexity applied to continuous scientific problems (information-based complexity). He collaborated in creating significant new algorithms including the Jenkins-Traub Algorithm for Polynomial Zeros, as well as the Kung-Traub, Shaw-Traub, and Brent-Traub algorithms. One of his research areas was continuous quantum computing. As of November 10, 2015, his works have been cited 8500 times, and he has an h-index of 35. From 1971 to 1979 he headed the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon and led it from a critical period to eminence (see Joseph Traub digital archive at Carnegie Mellon). From 1979 to 1989 he was the founding Chair of the Computer Science Department at Columbia. From 1986 to 1992 he served as founding Chair of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Academies and held the post again 2005\u20132009. Traub was founding Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Complexity, in 1985 until his death in 2015. Both his research and institution building work have had a major impact on the field of computer science.",

            "William Friedkin (born August 29, 1935) is an American film and television director, producer and screenwriter closely identified with the \"New Hollywood\" movement of the 1970s. Beginning his career in documentaries in the early 1960s, he is perhaps best known for directing the action thriller film \"The French Connection\" (1971) and the supernatural horror film \"The Exorcist\" (1973), the former of which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director. The latter also earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. His other films include the pioneering queer drama \"The Boys in the Band\" (1970), the suspense thriller \"Sorcerer\" (1977), the controversial crime film \"Cruising\" (1980), the action thriller \"To Live and Die in L.A.\" (1985), the psychological horror film \"Bug\" (2006), and the dark comedy \"Killer Joe\" (2011).",

            "Francis Albert Sinatra (December 12, 1915 \u2013 May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150million records worldwide. Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\", in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known residency performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of \"From Here to Eternity\", with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955), \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\" (1956), \"Come Fly with Me\" (1958), \" Only the Lonely\" (1958) and \"Nice 'n' Easy\" (1960). Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records, and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, \"September of My Years\" and starred in the Emmy-winning television special . After releasing \"Sinatra at the Sands\", recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album \"Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim\". It was followed by 1968's \"Francis A. & Edward K.\" with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released \"New York, New York\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998. Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for \"From Here to Eternity\", he starred in \"The Man with the Golden Arm\" (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as \"On the Town\" (1949), \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955), \"High Society\" (1956), and \"Pal Joey\" (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in \"Tony Rome\" (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, \"The Frank Sinatra Show\" began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. In crime, Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia. While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation After Sinatra's death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.",
            "\"Witchcraft\" is a popular song from 1957 composed by Cy Coleman with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh. It was released as a single by Frank Sinatra, and reached number six in the U.S., spending sixteen weeks on the charts. Elvis Presley sang this song in ."

            "William Somerville Shanks ARSA, RSA, RSW (28 September 1864 \u2013 28 July 1951) was a Scottish artist who was a tutor in painting and drawing at the Glasgow School of Art for 29 years. His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" sold for \u00a3181,250 at Sotheby's in 2008, a record for the artist. William Somerville Shanks was born in Gourock in Renfrewshire in 1864 to Helen and John Shanks (1923-1913), a horse proprietor who worked as a clothier and tailor in his native town of Paisley where generations of his family had been weavers. According to the 1871 census they were living at 1, George Place in Gourock with their four children: Mary, William, Agnes and Archibald. The 1881 census reveals that by then the family were living in Glasgow where William Somerville Shanks was working as a pattern designer for a curtain manufacturer. However, William Shanks had ambitions to be an artist, and after attended evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art under Francis Henry Newbery he made painting his career, in 1889 travelling to Paris to improve his skills, studying for three years at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant. In Paris Shanks became influenced by the paintings of Edouard Manet. His painting \"Tiddley Winks\" was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1897 and at one time was owned by Eliot Hodgkin who sold it to art dealer Charlotte Frank, the aunt of Anne Frank; Sir David Montagu Douglas Scott obtained it from her in 1962 for \u00a360. On loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 2007 to 2008, it sold at Sotheby's in 2008 for \u00a3181,250, a record for the artist. Shanks was to become a regular exhibitor at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy. Later Shanks was to return to the Glasgow School of Art (GSA) as a tutor of painting and drawing, remaining there for the next 29 years. A painter in oil and watercolours of portraits, interiors and still life but who preferred to work in oils, at the GSA Shanks was Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Antique and preparatory life 1910 to 1911; Assistant Professor (Drawing and Painting) Life, head life, portrait and costume model, painting, antique and still life 1913 to 1914 and 1924 to 1925; Lecturer (Drawing and Painting) Drawing, painting and composition 1925 to 1926 and 1929 to 1930; Drawing and Painting (School of Design, Pictorial and Commercial Art) 1930 to 1931; Drawing and Painting (Drawing and Painting) 1934 to 1935. In 1922 he received a silver medal at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. Although not a member of the Glasgow Boys Shanks was clearly influenced by their work and would have known Edward Atkinson Hornel and George Henry. Shanks was elected an Associate (ARSA) of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1923 and elected Member of the RSA in 1933. Shanks lived at 8 Parkgrove Terrace in Glasgow. A self portrait (see above) is held in the Collection of National Galleries of Scotland."

It stars Carol Kane, Colleen Dewhurst, Tony Beckley and Charles Durning. The film derives its story from the classic folk legend of\" the babysitter and the man upstairs\". The film has developed a large cult following over time because of the first 20 minutes, now consistently regarded as one of the scariest openings in movie history. The opening sequence was highly influential for the horror genre and was paid homage to in Wes Craven's\" Scream\" in the latter film's opening 12 minutes. \" When a Stranger Calls\" was released in the United States on October 26, 1979, by Columbia Pictures. The film was commercially successful, grossing$ 21,411,158 at the box office, though it received a mixed critical reception, with many praising the opening scene and performances, but criticism for its writing and lack of scares. It was followed by the 1993 made- for- cable sequel\" When a Stranger Calls Back\" and a remake in 2006.",

            "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\". John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over \u00a3300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a \"melodic genius\" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.",
            "\"Runaway Train\" is a pop rock song recorded by the British rock-pop musicians Elton John and Eric Clapton. A CD, cassette and 7\" vinyl single from Elton John's album \" The One\" was released in July 1992 which was later also accompanied by a music video shot the same year. It was also used in the \"Lethal Weapon 3\" movie soundtrack."

Among his early teachers were Carl Friedrich Zelter and Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. On Zelter's recommendation, Grell became in 1817 the organist at the Nikolaikirche in Berlin; he also joined the Sing- Akademie zu Berlin of which he was a lifelong member, and director from 1853 to 1876, succeeding Rungenhagen. He also became in 1853 professor of composition at the Prussian Academy of Arts. In 1864 he was awarded the order\" Pour le M\u00e9rite\". Grell's oeuvre includes three symphonies, three string quartets, and large amounts of vocal music. He is considered one of the leaders of the Palestrina renaissance in Europe. He was also the first to produce the Christmas Oratorio since the death of its composer, Johann Sebastian Bach."

            "Abisin Abbas (26 February 1902 \u2013 20 October 1961), better known by his pseudonym Andjar Asmara , was a dramatist and filmmaker active in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies. Born in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, he first worked as a reporter in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He became a writer for the Padangsche Opera in Padang, where he developed a new, dialogue-centric style, which later spread throughout the region. After returning to Batavia in 1929, he spent over a year as a theatre and film critic. In 1930 he joined the Dardanella touring troupe as a writer. He went to India in an unsuccessful bid to film his stage play \"Dr Samsi\". After leaving Dardanella in 1936, Andjar established his own troupe. He also worked at a publishers, writing serials based on successful films. In 1940 he was asked to join The Teng Chun's company, Java Industrial Film, helping with marketing and working as a director for two productions. After the Japanese occupation, during which time he stayed in theatre, Andjar made a brief return to cinema. He directed three films in the late 1940s and wrote four screenplays, which were produced as films in the early 1950s. He published a novel, \"Noesa Penida\" (1950). Afterward he worked for the remainder of his life writing serials based on local films and publishing film criticism. Historians recognise him as a pioneer of theatre and one of the first native Indonesian film directors, although he had little creative control of his productions.",
            "Gadis Desa (literally \"Maiden from the Village\") is a 1949 comedy from what is now Indonesia written and directed by Andjar Asmara. Starring Basuki Djaelani, Ratna Ruthinah, Ali Joego, and Djauhari Effendi, it follows the romantic hijinks of a village girl who is taken to be a rich man's second wife. The film, produced by a Dutch-run company, is recognised as the first in which future \"father of Indonesian film\" Usmar Ismail was involved."

            "Attack Force Z (alternatively titled The Z Men) is a 1982 Australian-Taiwanese World War II film directed by Tim Burstall. It is loosely based on actual events and was filmed in Taiwan in 1979. It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 1981. The film is noted for starring Mel Gibson and Sam Neill, who were relatively unknown in the US at the time but who went on to become international stars. The plot concerns Captain P.G. Kelly (Gibson), who leads a team from the elite Z Special Unit against the Empire of Japan during the Second World War. The film fictionalises the exploits of the Z Special Unit, which was also known as Z Force. It was a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit. Its main brief was to conduct reconnaissance and sabotage missions throughout Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.",
            "Timothy Burstall AM (20 April 1927 \u2013 19 April 2004) was an English Australian film director, writer and producer, best known for hit Australian movie \"Alvin Purple\" (1973) and its sequel \"Alvin Rides Again\". A key figure in Australian postwar cinema , Burstall was instrumental in rebuilding the Australian film industry at a time when it had been effectively dead for over a decade. He created groundbreaking Australian films including \"StorkEnd PlayEliza FraserThe Last of the Knucklemen\" and the 1987 adaptation of the D.H. Lawrence novel \"Kangaroo\". Burstall's films featured early appearances by many legendary Australian actors including Jack Thompson, Bruce Spence, Jacki Weaver, \"Alvin\" star Graeme Blundell, John Waters and Judy Davis. Burstall's wife, Betty Burstall, an important figure in her own right, founded the pioneering La Mama Theatre in Melbourne in the late 1960s, with which Tim was involved. Speaking just after Burstall's death, David Williamson said that Burstall \"couldn't stomach\" Australia's lack of a film industry. \" He was determined to do something about it and he had the energy and spirit to do it. (He) was a very important cultural figure: highly intelligent, widely read, with a succinct and often highly controversial opinion on everything.\""

            "Don Juan is a 1955 Austrian musical film directed by Walter Kolm-Velt\u00e9e and starring Cesare Danova, Josef Meinrad and Evelyn Cormand. It is an adaptation of the Mozart opera \"Don Giovanni\". The film was shot in the Soviet-controlled Rosenh\u00fcgel Studios in Vienna.",
            "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January 1756 \u2013 5 December 1791), baptised as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Born in Salzburg, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death have been much mythologized. He composed more than 600 works, many of which are acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the greatest and most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: \"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years\"."

            "Michael Findlay (August 27, 1937 \u2013 May 16, 1977) was an American filmmaker, producer and screenwriter. Along with his wife Roberta, Findlay created numerous low-budget Z movies in the 1960s and 1970s. They have been described as \"the most notorious filmmakers in the annals of sexploitation\". In the mid-to-late 1960s, Findlay was prominent among a small group of underground New York filmmakers (including Joseph W. Sarno, Joseph P. Mawra, and Lou Campa) that produced exploitation \"roughies\" (early slasher films which combined conventional horror or thriller stories with sadomasochistic sex scenes) for the grindhouse market. Sometimes he would direct under the alias Julian Marsh and act in his own films billed as Robert West. His wife Roberta (a.k.a. Anna Riva) was the cinematographer, co-writer, and supporting actress for many of their films together. They also employed the same actors repeatedly, most notably Uta Erickson, and Marie Brent, a.k.a. Janet Banzet. The Findlays were friends with George Weiss, producer of Ed Wood's \"Glen or Glenda\" and a series of fetishistic \"Olga\" films (\"Olga's House of ShameOlga's Girls\", et al.) . In 1964 Weiss encouraged them to make films in this new subgenre of violent sexploitation.",
            "Roberta Findlay (born 1948) is an American film director, cinematographer, producer and actress. She is best known for her work in the exploitation field. Her work has received increasing critical appreciation in recent years. She was married to Michael Findlay and they made a number of films together. After his death she continued to make movies."

            "Geoffrey Chaucer (\u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages, he is best known for \"The Canterbury Tales\". Chaucer has been styled the \"Father of English literature\". He was the first writer buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and astronomer, composing the scientific \"A Treatise on the Astrolabe\" for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a bureaucrat, courtier, diplomat, and member of parliament. Among Chaucer's many other works are \"The Book of the DuchessThe House of FameThe Legend of Good Women\", and \"Troilus and Criseyde\". He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of the Middle English vernacular when the dominant literary languages in England were still French and Latin.",

            "Marvin Gaye (born Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.; April 2, 1939 \u2013 April 1, 1984) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, earning him the nicknames \"Prince of Motown\" and \"Prince of Soul\". Gaye's Motown hits include \"Ain't That PeculiarHow Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\", and \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", and duet recordings with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Diana Ross, and Tammi Terrell. During the 1970s, he recorded the albums \" What's Going On\" and \"Let's Get It On\" and became one of the first artists in Motown, along with Stevie Wonder, to break away from the reins of a production company. His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. Following a period in Europe as a tax exile in the early 1980s, he released the 1982 hit \"Sexual Healing\", which won him his first two Grammy Awards, and its parent album \"Midnight Love\". Gaye's last television appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and on \"Soul Train\" which was his third and final appearance. On April 1, 1984, the day before his 45th birthday, Gaye's father, Marvin Gay Sr., fatally shot him at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards and other honors including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",
            "\"Midnight Lady\" is the first track on Marvin Gaye's 1982 album, \"Midnight Love\". It contains sly references to Rick James and his hit, \"Super Freak\"."

            "George Brackett Seitz (January 3, 1888 \u2013 July 8, 1944) was an American playwright, screenwriter, film actor and director. He was known for his screenplays for action serials, such as \"The Perils of Pauline\" (1914) and \"The Exploits of Elaine\" (1914). Seitz was born in Boston, Massachusetts, started his career as a playwright, and also wrote some fiction for \"up-market\" pulp magazines such as \"Adventure\" and \"People's Magazine\". Seitz did much of his early work in Fort Lee, New Jersey when many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based there. He was the director of more than one hundred films, the writer of more than thirty screenplays, and an actor in seven films. He worked at Columbia Pictures and at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer where he directed eleven films in the \"Andy Hardy\" series of the 1930s & 1940s. He died in Hollywood, California in 1944. Although an acquaintance of the cinematographer John F. Seitz, they were not related. He was the father of George B. Seitz Jr., who was a writer/director active in the 1940s and 1950s in films and television."

            "Charles Hutchison (December 3, 1879 \u2013 May 30, 1949) was an American film actor, director and screenwriter. He appeared in 49 films between 1914 and 1944. He also directed 33 films between 1915 and 1938. Though he directed numerous independent silent features, he is best remembered today as Path\u00e9's leading male serial star from 1918 to 1922. In 1923 he went to Britain and made two films \" Hutch Stirs 'em Up\" and \"Hurricane Hutch in Many Adventures\" for the Ideal Film Company. He made one last serial in 1926, \"Lightning Hutch\", for Arrow Film Company. It was meant to be a comeback vehicle, but the production company went into bankruptcy just as it was released. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and died in Hollywood, California. He was the person who convinced actor Karl Dane to return to films in the mid-1920s."

            "\"Too Darn Hot\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948). In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company. In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions (according to general opinion); in the stage version, the song represents the company of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allowed the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line ' According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to ' According to the latest report'. The song has also been covered by many artists.",
            "Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 \u2013 October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Many of his songs became standards noted for their witty, urbane lyrics, and many of his scores found success on Broadway and in film. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, Porter defied his grandfather's wishes and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn to musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike many successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote the lyrics as well as the music for his songs. After a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work. His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and '30s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, \"Kiss Me, Kate\". It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter's other musicals include \"Fifty Million FrenchmenDuBarry Was a LadyAnything GoesCan -Can\" and \"Silk Stockings\". His numerous hit songs include \"Night and DayBegin the BeguineI Get a Kick Out of YouWell , Did You Evah!I've Got You Under My SkinMy Heart Belongs to Daddy\" and \"You're the Top\". He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including \"Born to Dance\" (1936), which featured the song \" You'd Be So Easy to LoveRosalie\" (1937), which featured \"In the Still of the NightHigh Society\" (1956), which included \"True Love\"; and \"Les Girls\" (1957)."

            "Rosemarie Springer (also Rosemarie Alsen, n\u00e9e Lorenz; July 5, 1920 \u2013 April 2, 2019) was a German equestrian. Born in Danzig, she was the daughter of Werner Lorenz, who would later become an SS member and head of the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle in Nazi Germany. She first rode a horse at the age of two, sitting on her father's lap, and took up equestrianism at a young age. Her career was interrupted by World War II, however, and she served as a nurse during the conflict. She did not resume riding until 1950 but, soon after, her talents were spotted at a Berlin horse show. Among other international appearances, she participated in the individual dressage event at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where she finished seventh in a field of seventeen competitors. She retired from active competition in the late 1970s, having been the German national champion in women's dressage seven times. Following her competitive career, Springer took up judging and training, the latter of which occupied her time until at least 2012. In her late 80s she continued to ski twice a year and occasionally ride in informal tournaments in Germany. She married cement manufacturer Horst-Herbert Alsen in 1941 and divorced him in 1953 to marry Alsen's friend, journalist Axel Springer. This union lasted until 1961 when Springer left her to marry Helga Ludewig. On her 75th birthday, Springer was honored by the German Equestrian Federation (FN) for her contributions to the sport. She died on April 2, 2019 at the age of 98.",
            "Werner Lorenz (October 2, 1891 \u2013 March 13, 1974) was an SS functionary during the Nazi era. He was head of the \"Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle\" (VOMI) (Main Office for Ethnic Germans), an organization charged with resettling ethnic Germans in the \"German Reich\" from other parts of Europe, as well as colonising the occupied lands during World War II. After the war, Lorenz was sentenced to prison for crimes against humanity in 1948. He was released in 1955 and died in 1974."

            "\"Me and My Arrow\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson for his 1970 album \"The Point!\". It was also released as a single in 1971, reaching number 34 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number three on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song was composed as the theme for Oblio, the pointless boy, and his dog, Arrow. Although the song may be a reference to taking a direction and suddenly not knowing where to go, it is in fact about the friendship between Oblio and the dog. It is also a parable for discrimination.",
            "Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 \u2013 January 15, 1994), known mononymously as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who achieved the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a 3\u00bd octave range , Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists of his era to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours. The craft of his songs and the defiant attitude he projected remains a touchstone for later generations of indie rock musicians. Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family's poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing, and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP \"Pandemonium Shadow Show\", followed by a variety of releases that include a collaboration with Randy Newman (\"Nilsson Sings Newman\", 1970) and the original children's story \"The Point!\" (1971). His most commercially successful album, \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" (1971), produced the international top 10 singles \"Without You\" and \"Coconut\". His other top 10 hit, \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1968), was a prominent song in the 1969 film \"Midnight Cowboy\". A version of Nilsson's \"One\", released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.\nDuring a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered \"Nilsson\". He soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. In the 1970s, Nilsson and Lennon joined Starr as members of the Hollywood Vampires drinking club, embroiling themselves in a number of widely publicized, alcohol-fueled incidents. At the same time, they produced one collaborative album, \"Pussy Cats\" (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon's 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. Nilsson created the first remix album (\"Aerial Pandemonium Ballet\", 1971) and recorded the first mashup song (\"You Can't Do That\", 1967). He was voted No. 62 in \"Rolling Stone\"s 2015 list of the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\", where he was described as \"a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound, a crucial bridge between the baroque psychedelic pop of the late Sixties and the more personal singer-songwriter era of the Seventies\". The RIAA certified \"Nilsson Schmilsson\" and \"Son of Schmilsson\" as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. His honors include Grammy Awards for two of his recordings; Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male in 1970 for \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male in 1973 for \"Without You\". In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, \"Losst and Founnd\" (2019)."

            "Axel Julius de la Gardie (1637\u20131710) was a Swedish Field Marshal and was appointed Governor-General over Estonia. Axel Julius was the son of military commander Jacob De la Gardie and Ebba Brahe. He became colonel of an infantry regiment and a cavalry regiment and in 1684 he attained the rank of major general in the cavalry, and was a colonel in the Royal Guard. In 1668 he became lieutenant general and finally, later, Field Marshal. Upon the threat of war with Russia, he received orders to command the troops in Finland and Ingria and take necessary defensive actions. At the \"landtag\" he held in 1676 in \u00c5bo, the government granted the request of new war efforts. He married Sofia Juliana Arvidsdotter Forbus in 1664",
            "Field Marshal and Count Jacob Pontusson De la Gardie (Reval, 20 June 1583 \u2013 Stockholm, 22 August 1652) was a statesman and a soldier of the Swedish Empire, and a Marshal from 1620 onward. He was Privy Councilor from 1613 onward, Governor of Swedish Estonia in 1619\u20131622, Governor-General of Livonia in 1622\u20131628 (conquered by the Swedish Empire in 1621, and referred to as Swedish Livonia in 1629\u20131721), and Lord High Constable from 1620. He introduced reforms based on the then novel Dutch military doctrine into the Swedish army. He commanded the Swedish forces in Russia and against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He also served as one of the five regents jointly ruling Sweden during the minority of Queen Christina."

            "Fatherland (released as Singing the Blues in Red in the US) is a 1986 film about a German singer-songwriter, directed by Ken Loach and starring , , Cristine Rose and Sigfrit Steiner. The film is one of Loach's least-popular films, being referred to as \"a heavy-handed and absurd political drama\" in MIT's newspaper \"The Tech\" and Loach said in a 2016 Guardian interview that he \"made a mess\" of the film. As the film was partly in German, its audience was limited in English-speaking countries, where foreign-language films were uncommon in the 1980s. Between its cinematic release and the 2013 DVD release, the film was rare.",
            "Kenneth Charles Loach (born 17 June 1936) is an English filmmaker. His socially critical directing style and socialist ideals are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as poverty (\"Poor Cow\", 1967), homelessness (\"Cathy Come Home\", 1966), and labour rights (\"Riff-Raff\", 1991, and \"The Navigators\", 2001). Loach's film \"Kes\" (1969) was voted the seventh greatest British film of the 20th century in a poll by the British Film Institute. Two of his films, \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\" (2006) and \"I, Daniel Blake\" (2016), received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the ninth filmmaker to win the award twice. Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK are \"a , \"Catch-22\" situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary\"."

            "Robert Florey( 14 September 1900 \u2013 16 May 1979) was a French- American director, screenwriter, film journalist and actor. Born as Robert Fuchs in Paris, he became an orphan at an early age and was then raised in Switzerland. In 1920 he worked at first as a film journalist, then as an assistant and extra in featurettes from Louis Feuillade. Florey moved to the United States in 1921. As a director, Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low- budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant- garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio- system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939's\" Hotel Imperial\". He directed more than 50 movies. His most popular film is likely the first Marx Brothers feature\" The Cocoanuts\" of 1929, and his 1932 foray into Universal- style horror,\" Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film\" Daughter of Shanghai\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called\" widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films\".",
            "Reservation Road is a 2007 American drama film directed by Terry George and based on the book of the same title by John Burnham Schwartz, who, along with George, adapted the novel for the screenplay. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo, deals with the aftermath of a fatal car crash. It was released to theaters on October 19, 2007.",

            "Terence George( born 20 December 1952) is an Irish screenwriter and director. Much of his film work( e.g.\" The BoxerSome Mother's Son\", and\" In the Name of the Father\") involves\" The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. He was nominated for two Oscars: Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium( 1993;\" In the Name of the Father\"), and Best Writing, Original Screenplay( 2004;\" Hotel Rwanda\"). On 26 February 2012, he received an Oscar in the live action short film category for\" The Shore\"."

He was known for his investigative journalism and reporting on crime, including the Ju\u00e1rez murders, and his death was acknowledged by the Board of the Investigative Reporters & Editors in an official statement that condemned his murder.",
            "Teddy Weatherford (October 11, 1903 \u2212 April 25, 1945) was an American jazz pianist and an accomplished stride pianist. Weatherford was born in Pocahontas, Virginia and was raised in neighboring Bluefield, West Virginia. From 1915 through 1920, he lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he learned to play jazz piano. He then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he worked with such bands as that of Erskine Tate through the 1920s and with such jazz notables as Louis Armstrong and Johnny Dodds and impressed the young Earl Hines. Weatherford then traveled, first to Amsterdam, then around Asia playing professionally. In the early 1930s, he led a band at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. He joined Crickett Smith's band in Jakarta, Indonesia. Weatherford took over leadership of Smith's band in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1937. During World War II, he led a band in Calcutta, where he made radio broadcasts for the U. S. Armed Forces Radio Service. Performers with Weatherford's band included Bridget Althea Moe, Jimmy Witherspoon, Roy Butler and Gery Scott. Teddy Weatherford died of cholera in Calcutta, aged 41."

            "While London Sleeps is a 1926 Warner Bros. film about a police-dog, Rinty, who helps Scotland Yard defeat a dangerous criminal organisation known as the Mediterranean Brotherhood that operates out of the Limehouse district of London. Walter Morosco wrote the screenplay. It was the first of many films directed by Howard Bretherton, and one of several created for Rin Tin Tin, a German Shepherd dog used in films during the 1920s and 1930s. The film was also released with a Vitaphone sound-on-disc soundtrack with a music score and sound effects, and only the sound discs survive today. The British release prints censored the more horrific aspects of the film. George Kotsonaros only appeared in two horror films, this one and \"The Wizard\" (1927), and he played a beast-man in both movies. He died in a car accident in Alabama in 1933.",
            "Howard Bretherton (13 February 1890, Tacoma, Washington \u2013 12 April 1969, San Diego, California) was an American film director, film editor, and the father of film editor David Bretherton."

In the late 1970s he mainly worked with a group of actors known as the Venom Mob. Chang Cheh is also known for his long-time collaboration with writer Ni Kuang.",

He was the first husband of Jos\u00e9phine Tascher de la Pagerie, who later married Napoleon Bonaparte and became Empress of the First Empire. Alexandre was arrested in March 1794 and, following his sentence of death during the Reign of Terror, was executed by guillotine in Paris's \"Place de la R\u00e9volution\".",

He was born in Paris, France, and became the stepson and adopted child (but not the heir to the imperial throne) of Napoleon I.

            "Give Us Our Skeletons! (Antakaa Meille Luurankomme in Finnish, Oaivveskaldjut in North Sami) is a 1999 documentary film directed by Paul-Anders Simma about Niillas Somby, a Sami man who retraces his family ancestry as he searches for the head of his ancestor, Mons Somby. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jakobsen H\u00e6tta were executed by decapitation on 14 October 1854 for murder, following the 1852 Kautokeino rebellion against the local Norwegian government in which two people were murdered. Their heads were claimed by the government for scientific research, and were held as part of a collection of 900 skulls at the Anatomical Institute, in Oslo. The movie describes three parallel plots; the first is Niillas Somby's story on how he became one of the most celebrated protesters during the Alta Dam Protests between 1979-1981 near Kautokeino, Norway. In the years that followed, he traveled in exile to Canada where he was given sanctuary by the Iroquois First Nation, and later returned to Norway. The second plot was the disturbing examination of the scientific racism and racial classification movement that was considered an accepted fact by Scandinavian scientists from the early 19th century until the 1950s. This included the plundering of Sami graves for their skeletons and the forced sterilization of the Sami and other peoples in Scandinavia who were viewed as competing with the \"noble races\", as part of a larger eugenics program. The third and final plot was Niillas Somby's emotional struggle with bringing Mons Somby's skull home for a proper burial.",
            "Lloyd Francis Bacon (December 4, 1889 \u2013 November 15, 1955) was an American screen, stage and vaudeville actor and film director. As a director he made films in virtually all genres, including westerns, musicals, comedies, gangster films, and crime dramas. He was one of the directors at Warner Bros. in the 1930s who helped give that studio its reputation for gritty, fast-paced \"torn from the headlines\" action films. And, in directing Warner Bros.' \"42nd Street\", he joined the movie's song-and-dance-number director, Busby Berkeley, in contributing to \"an instant and enduring classic [that] transformed the musical genre.\"",

            "141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence is a 1975 Hungarian drama film directed by Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri. It was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival where F\u00e1bri won a Special Prize for Directing.",
            "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri( 15 October 1917 \u2013 23 August 1994) was a Hungarian film director and screenwriter. His films\" The Boys of Paul Street\"( 1969) and\" Hungarians\"( 1978) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His 1965 film\" Twenty Hours\" shared the Grand Prix with\" War and Peace\" at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1969 film\" The Toth Family\" was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1975 film\" 141 Minutes from the Unfinished Sentence\" was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, where he won a Special Prize for Directing. F\u00e1bri wanted to become an artist from an early age on. He studied painting and graduated at the Hungarian College of Fine Arts. He began working in the Hungarian film industry in 1950 as a production designer. He directed his first film\" ViharStorm\") in 1951. He became an internationally acclaimed director with his third feature\" K\u00f6rhintaMerry Go- Round\") in 1956. He continued directing and writing until the early 1980s. After his retirement from the film industry F\u00e1bri taught on the Hungarian University of Theatrical and Film Arts. In his last years he wrote screenplays; they were never made. F\u00e1bri was also the president of the Hungarian Film Artist Union from 1959 to 1981. F\u00e1bri's style of filmmaking can be described mainly as\" classical\", using academic techniques of art filmmaking. His greatest influences were the Italian Neorealism and French Poetic Realism. He experimented with narrative and flashback techniques for a while in the 1960s( in his films\" Nappali s\u00f6t\u00e9ts\u00e9g\" and\" H\u00fasz \u00f3ra\") and his 1976 film\" Az \u00f6t\u00f6dik pecs\u00e9t\" contains some highly surrealist scenes, but overall he never used the mannerisms of modernist film in his works. For this reason the K\u00e1d\u00e1r regime favored F\u00e1bri over more controversial and experimental directors like Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3. The film won the Golden Prize at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. At the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979, he was awarded with the Honorable Prize for the contribution to cinema. He was known as a perfectionist who wrote, drawn and choreographed every scene to the most precise detail months before production began and never improvised anything. His reputation as a rigid, tyrannical director was somewhat contradicted by his friendly and kind behaviour towards the British and American child actors on the set of\" The Boys of Paul Street\". F\u00e1bri made nearly all of his films based on literary material( novels or short stories) and wrote the screenplays himself. His constant theme was the question of humanity. Many of his films are set in or around World War II. Two of his frequent collaborators were actress Mari T\u00f6r\u0151csik and cinematographer Gy\u00f6rgy Ill\u00e9s. In 1969 he played the role of prosecuted statesman Zolt\u00e1n D\u00e1niel in his friend P\u00e9ter Bacs\u00f3's cult satire,\" A tan \u00fa The Witness\") as his sole acting job. F\u00e1bri died in a heart attack at the age of 76 in 1994. His legal successor is Peter Fabri( b. 1985).",

            "Jacques Jaccard( September 11, 1886 \u2013 July 24, 1960) was an American film director, writer and actor whose achievements in cinema were mostly in silent film. Jaccard was born in New York City. He directed 86 films and wrote the scripts for almost 80 films. The best- known of his films as a director was\" The Diamond from the Sky\"( 1915). Jaccard began his movie career in 1913 as an actor. While working as an actor, he also worked as an assistant director. He began working for Universal Pictures and specialized in western and action films. In the mid-1920s he began working for lower- rent studios such as Goodwill Pictures, Syndicate Pictures and Arrow Pictures. When movies with sound became popular, Jaccard's career went downhill until he directed his last film, Se\u00f1or Jim, in 1936. After that he worked as a screenwriter and dialogue director. In 1940 he rejoined Universal's serial department as a dialogue coach, working on such popular serials as\" Gang Busters\" and\" Adventures of the Flying Cadets\". Jaccard retired in 1944 and died in Los Angeles, California, 1960.",

            "Arthur Hiller,( November 22, 1923 \u2013 August 17, 2016) was a Canadian- American television and film director with over 33 films to his credit during a 50- year career. He began his career directing television in Canada and later in the U.S. By the late 1950s he began directing films, most often comedies. He also directed dramas and romantic subjects, such as\" Love Story\"( 1970), which was nominated for seven Oscars. Hiller collaborated on films with screenwriters Paddy Chayefsky and Neil Simon. Among his other films were\" The Americanization of Emily\"( 1964),\" Tobruk\"( 1967),\" The Hospital\"( 1971),\" The Out- of- Towners\"( 1970),\" Plaza Suite\"( 1971),\" The Man in the Glass Booth\"( 1975),\" Silver Streak\"( 1976),\" The In- Laws\"( 1979) and\" Outrageous Fortune\"( 1987). Hiller served as president of the Directors Guild of America from 1989 to 1993 and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1993 to 1997. He was the recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2002. An annual film festival in Hiller's honor was held from 2006 until 2009 at his alma mater, Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts.",
            "Promise Her Anything is a 1965 British- American romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Hiller. The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is based on a story by Arne Sultan and Marvin Worth.",
            "I Was a Communist for the FBI is a 1951 American film noir crime film directed by Gordon Douglas starring Frank Lovejoy, Dorothy Hart, Philip Carey and James Millican. The film was produced by Bryan Foy who was head of Warners B picture unit until 1942. It was also a radio show starring Dana Andrews with 78 episodes that ran from April 23, 1952 until October 14, 1953. The film was based on a series of stories written by Matt Cvetic that appeared in\" The Saturday Evening Post\". The stories were later turned into a best- selling book and radio series. The story follows Cvetic, who infiltrated a local Communist Party cell for nine years and reported back to the Federal Bureau of Investigation( FBI) on their activities. The film and radio show are, in part, artifacts of the McCarthy era, as well as a time capsule of American society during the Second Red Scare. The purpose of both is partly to warn people about the threat of Communist subversion of American society. The tone of the show is ultra-patriotic, with Communists portrayed as racist, vindictive, and tools of a totalitarian foreign power, the Soviet Union.",
            "Gordon Douglas( December 15, 1907 \u2013 September 29, 1993) was an American film director, who directed many different genres of films over the course of a five- decade career in motion pictures. He was a native of New York City."

            "\"Joe the Lion\" is a song written by David Bowie in 1977 for the album Heroes. It was produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti and features lead guitar by Robert Fripp. Like the album as a whole, the song demonstrates the influence of German Krautrock. The track is in part a tribute to performance artist Chris Burden, who was famous for having himself nailed to a Volkswagen in 1974 (\"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are\") and for having an assistant shoot him in the arm at an art gallery in 1971 (\"Guess you'll buy a gun / You'll buy it secondhandJoe the Lion\" has also been seen as reflecting Bowie's struggle to overcome the emotional numbness that appeared to permeate his previous album \"LowYou get up and sleep\"). Bowie played the song live on the 1983 Serious Moonlight and 1995 Outside tours, and it was considered (but ultimately not performed) for his 1987 Glass Spider Tour. \"Joe the Lion\" has been described by critic Chris O'Leary as \"phenomenal\" and \"one of the high peaks of Bowie's late Seventies\".",
            "David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 \u2013 10 January 2016), known professionally as David Bowie , was an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of the world's best-selling music artists. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released eleven number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Born in Brixton, South London, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\" became his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"Starman\" and album \" The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\", which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album \"Young Americans\". In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film \" The Man Who Fell to Earth\", directed by Nicolas Roeg, and released \"Station to Station\". The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the electronic-inflected album \"Low\" (1977), the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\"Heroes (1977) and \"Lodger\" (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its parent album \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", and \"Under Pressure\", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with \"Let's Dance\"; the album's title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\" (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in \"Labyrinth\" (1986), Pontius Pilate in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" (1988), and Nikola Tesla in \"The Prestige\" (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with \"The Next Day.\" He remained musically active until he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, \"Blackstar\" (2016)."

            "Cristiano Ronaldo Madeira International Airport, commonly known as Madeira Airport or Funchal Airport, is an international airport in the civil parish of Santa Cruz in the Portuguese archipelago and autonomous region of Madeira. The airport is located east- northeast of the regional capital, Funchal, after which it is sometimes informally named. It mostly hosts flights to European metropolitan destinations due to Madeira's importance as a leisure destination, and is pivotal in the movement of cargo in and out of the archipelago of Madeira. It is the fourth- busiest airport in Portugal. The airport is named after Madeiran football player Cristiano Ronaldo. The airport is considered one of the most peculiarly perilous airports in the world due to its location and its spectacular runway construction. It received the\" Outstanding Structure Award\" in 2004 by the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering. The History Channel program\" Most Extreme Airports\" ranked it as the ninth most dangerous airport in the world and the third most dangerous in Europe. Pilots must undergo additional training to land at the airport.",

            "Out of Sight is a 1998 American crime comedy film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Scott Frank, adapted from Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name. The first of several collaborations between Soderbergh and actor George Clooney, it was released on June 26, 1998. The film stars Clooney and Jennifer Lopez and co-stars Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Dennis Farina, Nancy Allen, Steve Zahn, Catherine Keener, and Albert Brooks. There are also special appearances by Michael Keaton, briefly reprising his role as Ray Nicolette from Quentin Tarantino's\" Jackie Brown\" the previous year, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film received Academy Award nominations for Adapted Screenplay and Editing and won the Edgar Award for best screenplay and the National Society of Film Critics awards for best film, screenplay, and director. The film led to a spinoff TV series in 2003,\" Karen Sisco\".",
            "The Tenth Symphony is a 1918 silent French drama film directed by Abel Gance.",
            "Abel Gance( 25 October 188910 November 1981) was a French film director and producer, writer and actor. A pioneer in the theory and practice of montage, he is best known for three major silent films:\" J'accuse\"( 1919),\" La Roue\"( 1923), and\" Napol\u00e9on\"( 1927).",
            "Steven Andrew Soderbergh( born January 14, 1963) is an American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, and actor. He is an early pioneer of independent cinema. Soderbergh's directorial breakthrough\u2014indie drama\" Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"( 1989) \u2014lifted him into the public spotlight as a notable presence in the film industry. At 26, Soderbergh became the youngest solo director to win the Palme d' Or at the Cannes Film Festival which garnered the film worldwide commercial success, among numerous accolades. His breakthrough saw him to Hollywood where he directed crime comedy\" Out of Sight\"( 1998); biopic\" Erin Brockovich\"( 2000) and crime drama film\" Traffic\"( 2000), the latter winning him the Academy Award for Best Director. He found further popular and critical success with the\" Ocean's\" trilogy and film franchise( 2001 \u2013 18);\" Contagion\"( 2011);\" Magic Mike\"( 2012);\" Side Effects\"( 2013);\" Logan Lucky\"( 2017); and\" Unsane\"( 2018). Despite his film career spanning a multitude of genres, his cinematic niche centers on psychological, crime, and heist thrillers. His films have grossed over US$ 2.2 billion worldwide and garnered nine Oscar nominations, winning seven. Soderbergh's films often revolve around familiar concepts often used for big budget Hollywood movies but with an avant garde arthouse approach to them. They center on the themes of shifting personal identities, vengeance, sexuality, morality, and the human condition. His feature films retain distinctive cinematography as a result of his liberal use of avant- garde cinema coupled with unconventional film and camera formats. Many of Soderbergh's films are anchored by multi-dimensional storylines with plot twists, nonlinear storytelling, experimental sequencing, suspenseful soundscapes, and third person vantage points. Uniquely, he often serves as his own director of photography and editor under the respective pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard."

            "Visceral Evisceration was an Austrian metal band that blended gothic metal and death- doom. They were one of the first extreme metal bands to include female operatic vocals, contrasted by male grunts and clear vocals. Their songs are generally long and epic, combining slow doom riffs with mid-paced gothic metal. Lyrically, they focused on issues more prevalent in goregrind, seemingly inspired by bands as Carcass and country- mates Pungent Stench. After a demo, they released their sole album,\" Incessant Desire for Palatable Flesh\", on Napalm Records. After the release of the album, they left Napalm and changed their name to\" As I Lay Dying\"( not to be confused with the US namesake), releasing a promo in 1995 before breaking up.",
            "The Magic Mushrooms were an American psychedelic garage rock band in the 1960s. The Magic Mushrooms were originally composed of five students from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. They were: The Magic Mushrooms came together shortly after they started their freshman year and practiced in the freshman commons until they started playing gigs. They named themselves the Magic Mushrooms after Allen Ginsberg suggested that name during an on- campus lecture in the fall of 1965. In the Spring of 1966, they were joined by Josh Rice( Vocals, Flute, Harmonica), who had been the lead singer of a competing band on the Penn Campus, and 2 or 3 months after Josh arrived, Dick and Charles left the band, and were replaced by Bob Grady and Chris Barbieri, on keyboards and bass, both of whom had been in a band with Stu for a couple years previously. The band was heard by Sonny Casella while playing at Drexel University later in the Fall and he signed on as the Manager shortly thereafter. They played mostly around the Philadelphia area into the Spring of 1966, most of their bookings being arranged by their new manager. Their first single,\" It's A- Happening\" was released in September 1966, which reached number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week in November of that year before dropping off. It was included on the compilation in 1972. \" It's A- Happening\" was written by Stu Freeman and Josh Rice. Sonny Casella produced, arranged and mixed the song. When Herb Alpert of A&M Records found out what\" magic mushrooms\" were, he pulled the record off the market because the band would not change their name. They are not to be confused with\" The Magic Mushroom\", a different American psychedelic garage rock band from San Diego who happened to release their one and only single(\" I'm Gone\" b/w\" Cry Baby\") the same year."

            "George Miller AO (born 3 March 1945) is an Australian filmmaker and former physician. He is best known for his \"Mad Max\" franchise, whose second installment \"The Road Warrior\" and fourth, , have been hailed as amongst the greatest action films of all time. Aside from the \"Mad Max\" films, Miller has been involved in a wide range of projects. These include the Academy Award-winning \"Babe\" and \"Happy Feet\" film series. Miller is a co-founder of the production houses Kennedy Miller Mitchell, formerly known as Kennedy Miller, and Dr. D Studios. His younger brother Bill Miller and Doug Mitchell have been producers on almost all the films in Miller's later career, since the death of his original producing partner Byron Kennedy. In 2006, Miller won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for \"Happy Feet\" (2006). He has been nominated for five other Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay in 1992 for \"Lorenzo's Oil\", Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay in 1995 for \"Babe\", and Best Picture and Best Director for \"Fury Road\" in 2015.",
            "Babe: Pig in the City is a 1998 Australian-American comedy-drama film and the sequel to the 1995 film \"Babe\". It is co-written, produced and directed by George Miller, who co-wrote and produced the original film. Most of the actors from the first film reappeared as their respective roles, including James Cromwell, Miriam Margolyes, Hugo Weaving, Danny Mann, Roscoe Lee Browne and Magda Szubanski with newcomers featuring Glenne Headly, Steven Wright, James Cosmo, Myles Jeffrey, and Mickey Rooney. However, most of them have only brief appearances, as the story focuses on the journey of Babe and Arthur Hoggett's wife Esme in the fictional city of Metropolis and Elizabeth Daily replaces Christine Cavanaugh as Babe. The film was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1998 Academy Awards. Despite failing to match its predecessor in critical and commercial reception, \"Babe: Pig in the City\" has been recognized as a cult film since its original release."

            "That Certain Thing is a 1928 silent film comedy directed by Frank Capra. It was Capra's first film for Harry Cohn's Columbia Pictures.",
            "Frank Russell Capra (born Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897 \u2013 September 3, 1991) was an Italian-American film director, producer and writer who became the creative force behind some of the major award-winning films of the 1930s and 1940s. Born in Italy and raised in Los Angeles from the age of five, his rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to consider him the \"American Dream personified.\" Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the 1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations in other categories. Among his leading films were \"It Happened One Night\" (1934), \"You Can't Take It with You\" (1938), and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939); Capra was nominated as Best Director and as producer for Academy Award for Best Picture on all three films, winning both awards on the first two. During World War II, Capra served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and produced propaganda films, such as the \"Why We Fight\" series. After World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. In ensuing decades, however, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics. Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry, engaging in various political and social activities. He served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the Directors Guild of America."

            "Terang Boelan( Indonesian for\" Full MoonTerang Bulan\" in the Perfected Spelling System) is a 1937 film from the Dutch East Indies( now Indonesia). Written by Saeroen, directed by Albert Balink, and starring Rd Mochtar, Roekiah and Eddie T. Effendi,\" Terang Boelan\" follows two lovers who elope after one is almost forced to marry an opium smuggler. The film was shot in the Indies and Singapore, and was partially inspired by the 1936 Hollywood film\" The Jungle Princess\". It was aimed at native audiences and included\" keroncong\" music, which was popular at the time, and several actors from Balink's previous work\" Pareh\"( 1936). \" Terang Boelan\" was a commercial success in both the Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at Malay audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was followed for decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran described it as a turning point in the history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era,\" Terang Boelan\" has been lost since at least the 1970s.",

            "Billy Elliot is a 2000 British dance drama film about a boy aspiring to be a professional dancer while dealing with the negative stereotype of the male ballet dancer. Set in County Durham, North East England during the 1984\u201385 coal miners' strike, it was written by Lee Hall and directed by Stephen Daldry with music composed by Stephen Warbeck. Production was by Greg Brenman and Jon Finn, co-production by BBC Films, Tiger Aspect Pictures and Working Title Films. The film stars Jamie Bell as 11-year-old Billy, Gary Lewis as his coal miner father, Jamie Draven as Billy's older brother, and Julie Walters as his ballet teacher. The film was theatrically released on 29 September 2000. It received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million on a \u00a33 million budget. It received several accolades including the BAFTA Award for Best Film and three Academy Award nominations. In 2001, author Melvin Burgess was commissioned to write the novelisation of the film based on Lee Hall's screenplay. The story was adapted for the West End stage as \"Billy Elliot the Musical\" in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on Broadway in 2008."

Under the title appears the description, \"As inspired by the Current Best Seller 'My Sister and I' by Dirk van der Heide. \" The lyric is in the voice of a child who has\u2014with a sister\u2014left a war zone by boat and begun a new life abroad. The line \"the fear/ That came from a troubled sky\" along with the song's release date implies the evacuation of children from the countries ravaged by World War II, such as the London Blitz the previous winter.",

            "Walter Francis\" Walt\" Sweeney( April 18, 1941 \u2013 February 2, 2013) was an American football offensive lineman and end, who played college football at Syracuse University, where he made the school's all- century team. He also played in the North- South Game and the College All- Star Game. A first- round draft pick of the San Diego Chargers in 1963, Sweeney helped them win the American Football League championship.",
            "Giuseppe Bellenghi( 1847 in Bologna \u2013 October 17, 1902 in Florence) was a virtuoso violincellist and mandolinist, and a composer. He was remembered in 1914 as\" a devoted champion of the mandolin.\" Bellinghi studied violincello under\" several well- known Italian masters,\" including Teodulo and Jefte Sbolci. He gained a reputation as a cello virtuoso in Florence, and worked in important concerts in Bologna and Florence, and as first violincellist in the theatres. He taught the violoncello as well, and cellist Elvira Paoli was one of his students. While teaching violoncello, Bellenghi\" became enamored of the mandolin,\" which was in fashion at the time with the aristocracy and nobility in Italy. He worked to spread its popularity further. He began to perform in concerts as a mandolinist between 1880 and 1900. Bellenghi organized concerts in Florence and Bologna, where\" celebrated mandolinists, Riccardo Rovinazzi, Giuseppe Silvestri, and Caroline Grimaldi took part.\" He was also one of three teachers to be given the privilege of teaching the mandolin to Princess Margherita of the Royal family of Italy; Belisario Mattera and Constantino Bertucci also received that honor. He began to write for the mandolin, creating\" light selections.\" He first published with Ricordi in Milan, but later founded Forlivesi& Company Publishing in Florence, which was a major music publisher when he died in 1902, publishing more than 7000 musical compositions. Bellenghi's own compositions were very numerous, and he published many lighter works under the name of G. B. Pirani. He wrote the comprehensive\" Method for the mandolin in three parts\", which is published in four languages, French, English, Italian and German. He also wrote a series of daily exercises for the mandolin, entitled\" La ginnastica del mandolino\", with the object of strengthening the fourth finger, and a volume of\" Ascending and descending major and minor scales in all positions for the mandolin\". He wrote\" Six duos for two mandolins\" and a\" Theoretical treatise on the rudiments of music\". In addition to his mandolin books, Bellenghi was the first to write and publish a method for the modern lute, and under the name\" G. B. Pirani\", methods for mandola and guitar. The most popular of his compositions were the waltzes\" Profumi Orientali\" and\" Renato\", both of which rapidly passed many editions. When it was published,\" Renato\" was\" the foremost composition for mandolin band\". Profumi Orientali was also arranged by its author as a song with French, Italian, and English words. Bellenghi wrote many pieces for piano solo and two pianos, songs with piano or guitar accompaniments, and about seventy various arrangements and original compositions for mandolin band. He also wrote about fifty similar works for guitar solo. He wrote a set of\" Variations for the mandolin\" with accompaniment of piano or guitar\u2014variations of Paganini's variations on the\" Carnival of Venice\". Biographer Philp J. Bone said that\" this work alone, places Bellenghi in the foremost rank as a mandolin virtuoso and thorough artist on the instrument, who enlarged its scope and extended its musical possibilities, as nothing of so advanced a nature for the mandolin had been published hitherto.\" Bellinghi died when he was 55. His music publish business was continued by his son, Renato Bellenghi."

            "Johannes Roberts (born 24 May 1976) is a British film director, producer, and writer who is mainly known for horror and thriller films.",
            "47 Meters Down: Uncaged is a 2019 survival horror film directed by Johannes Roberts and written by Roberts and Ernest Riera, and a stand alone sequel to \"47 Meters Down\" (2017). None of the cast from the previous film returns here. The new cast consists of Sophie N\u00e9lisse, Corinne Foxx, Brianne Tju, Sistine Stallone, Davi Santos, Khylin Rhambo, Brec Bassinger, and John Corbett. The plot follows a group of girls who scuba dive to a sunken Mayan city, only to be trapped by a group of sharks that are swimming in it. \"47 Meters Down: Uncaged\" was released in the United States on August 16, by Entertainment Studios. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its acting and suspence, but criticism for its weaker CGI and lack of scares. The film had grossed $38 million against a $12 million budget, making the franchise grossing over $100 million worldwide."

            "Balanathan Benjamin Mahendran (20 May 1939 13 February 2014), commonly known as Balu Mahendra, was a legendary cinematographer, director, screenwriter and film editor who worked predominantly in Tamil cinema. Born in a Eelam Tamil family, he developed a passion for photography and literature at a young age. After witnessing the shoot of David Lean's \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) during a school trip in Sri Lanka, he was drawn towards filmmaking. He graduated from the London University and started his career as a draughtsman with the Sri Lankan Government. In 1966, he moved to India and gained admission to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to pursue a course in motion picture photography. Upon completion of his diploma, he entered Malayalam cinema as a cinematographer in the early 1970s. After working in over 20 films as a cinematographer, Mahendra made his directorial debut in 1977 with the Kannada film \"Kokila\". Since then, he directed over 20 films in a span of 36 years. Along with P. Bharathiraja and J. Mahendran, he is regarded as a trendsetter in Tamil cinema. During the tail end of his career, he established a film school in Chennai, which offers courses in cinematography, direction and acting. Following a brief phase of poor health, Mahendra died of cardiac arrest in February 2014. Widely regarded as an auteur, Mahendra usually scripted and edited his films apart from shooting them. He was the recipient of six National Film Awards (including two for Best Cinematography), five Filmfare Awards South and several state government awards.",
            "Moondram Pirai  is a 1982 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written, directed and filmed by Balu Mahendra. The film stars Kamal Haasan and Sridevi, while Silk Smitha, Poornam Vishwanathan and Y. G. Mahendran play supporting roles. It revolves around a school teacher who rescues a woman suffering from retrograde amnesia, from a brothel, and protects her in his house located in Ketti. The rest of the film shows how the woman recovers her memory with the teacher's help. \"Moondram Pirai\" is based on Balu Mahendra's brief relationship with actress Shoba, who died in 1980, shortly after their marriage. The first film independently produced by G. Thyagarajan and G. Saravanan's Sathya Jyothi Films, it was predominantly shot in Ooty and Ketti, with further shooting also taking place in Bangalore. The music for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics written by Kannadasan, Vairamuthu and Gangai Amaran. It also featured the last song written by Kannadasan to be recorded before his death in 1981. \"Moondram Pirai\" was released on 19 February 1982 to positive critical reception. It was also a box office success and had a theatrical run of 329 days. The film won two National Film Awards: Best Actor for Haasan, and Best Cinematography for Mahendra. It also won the Best Director Award for Mahendra at the Filmfare Awards, and five Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, including Best Film (third prize), Best Actor (Haasan) and Best Actress (Sridevi). Mahendra remade the film in Hindi as \"Sadma\", with Haasan, Sridevi and Smita reprising their roles."

            "Mack V. Wright (March 9, 1894 \u2013 August 14, 1965) was an American actor and film director. Active as a director from 1920 to the late 1940s, he also had an extensive career as an assistant director, second-unit director and production manager. His heyday was in the 1930s, when he directed or co-directed serials for Republic Pictures and made westerns for Monogram Pictures, often with John Wayne. He was also an actor, appearing in his first film in 1914 and his last in 1934, almost all of them westerns."

            "Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, actor, television producer, entrepreneur and investor. Born in the South Jamaica neighborhood of the borough of Queens, Jackson began selling drugs at age twelve during the 1980s crack epidemic. He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced \"Power of the Dollar\" for Columbia Records, but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after Jackson released the compilation album \" Guess Who's Back? \", he was discovered by Eminem and signed to Shady Records, under the aegis of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. With the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\"), Jackson became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence with East Coast hip hop group G-Unit (which he leads \"de facto\"). In 2003, he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Jackson had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, \"The Massacre\", which was released in 2005. He released his fifth studio album, \"Animal Ambition\", in 2014 and as of 2019 is working on his sixth studio album, \"Street King Immortal\". He executive produces and stars in the show \"Power\", which airs on Starz. During his career Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. He has pursued an acting career, appearing in the semi-autobiographical film \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" (2005), the Iraq War film \"Home of the Brave\" (2006) and \"Righteous Kill\" (2008). 50 Cent was ranked the sixth-best artist of the 2000s and the third-best rapper (behind Eminem and Nelly) by Billboard. \" Rolling Stone\" consider \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" and \"In da Club\" to be in their lists of \"100 Best albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13 respectively."

            "The Belt is a 1989 Italian erotic drama film directed by Giuliana Gamba. It is based on the drama play with the same name by Alberto Moravia.",
            "Human Traffic is a 1999 British- Irish independent film written and directed by Welsh filmmaker Justin Kerrigan. It is a cult film of the Cool Cymru era of arts in Wales. The film explores themes of coming of age, drug and club cultures, as well as relationships. It includes scenes provoking social commentary and the use of archive footage to provide political commentary. The plot of the film revolves around five twenty- something friends and their wider work and social circle, the latter devotees of the club scene, taking place over the course of a drug- fuelled weekend in Cardiff, Wales. A central feature is the avoidance of moralising about the impact of 1990s dance lifestyle; instead the film concentrates on recreating the\" vibe, the venues and the mood\" of the dance movement from the 1988 \u2013 89\" second summer of love\" to the film's release in 1999. In the first 25 minutes of the film Lee, the 17- year- old brother of central character Nina, enthuses\" I am about to be part of the chemical generation\" and lists, using the slang of the period, a series of drugs that he might experiment with later that night. The film is narrated by one of the stars, John Simm, featuring numerous cameo appearances. It is also the film debut of Danny Dyer as well as referencing another drug culture film of the era,\" Trainspotting\". With an original budget of \u00a3 340,000, the production eventually came in for \u00a3 2,200,000; the film was a financial success, taking in \u00a3 2,500,000 at the UK box office alone, also enjoying good VHS and DVD sales. \" Human Traffic\" was critically well- received with largely positive reviews, and has achieved cult status, especially amongst subcultures such as the rave culture. A sequel, known as\" Human Traffic 2: Revolution\" was announced in April 2019 and is due for release at an unknown date. Dyer, Parkes and Reynolds are due to reprise their roles."

            "Martyrs of the Alamo( also known as The Birth of Texas) is a 1915 American historical war drama film written and directed by Christy Cabanne. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including Sam De Grasse, Douglas Fairbanks, Walter Long and Alfred Paget. Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in\" The Lamb\", was released prior to this picture. The film features the Siege of B\u00e9xar, Battle of the Alamo and Battle of San Jacinto. While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in San Antonio in 1836 as a group of ill- mannered drunks. One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her. The white woman reports the incident to her husband, Almeron Dickinson, who in turn shoots the Mexican officer. In his book\" Remembering the Alamo\", author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced. A copy of the film is preserved at the Library of Congress.",
            "Brian Desmond Hurst( 12 February 1895 \u2013 26 September 1986) was a Belfast- born film director. With over thirty films in his filmography, Hurst was Ireland's most prolific film director during the 20th century, and hailed as Northern Ireland's best film director. He is perhaps best known for the 1951\" A Christmas Carol\" adaptation\" Scrooge\".",

It was made at Denham Studios with sets designed by the art director Alex Vetchinsky."

            "\"I've Heard That Song Before\" is a 1942 popular song about nostalgia with music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Sammy Cahn. It was introduced by Martha O'Driscoll (dubbed by Margaret Whiting) in the 1942 film \"Youth on Parade\". The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1942 but lost out to \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d. It was recorded by Harry James and his Orchestra with Helen Forrest on vocal on July 31, 1942. This was the last day of recording before the Musician Union's ban. The recording was issued on Columbia 36668 and became a number one hit on both the pop charts and the Harlem Hit Parade in the US in early 1943. This version of the song can be heard in Woody Allen's 1986 movie \"Hannah and Her Sisters\"."

            "Giovanni Antonio Scalfarotto( c. 1700 \u2013 1764) was an Italian architect from Venice. He is said to have taught architectural drawing to the engraver Giovanni Piranesi. Like many eclectic architects of his time, it is difficult to pin down a specific style. He was likely limited in part because of the weight of architectural tradition in many of his projects. For example, his designs for the fa\u00e7ade of the chiesa of San Rocco, completed posthumously, looked peculiarly antique, but are meant to match the adjacent Scuola di San Rocco. He designed the present bell tower for the church of San Salvador and San Bartolomeo( 1747- 1752) near the Rialto. He is best known for the designs of the church of San Simeone Piccolo across the Grand Canal from the modern railroad station. His nephew, Tommaso Temanza was also an architect in Venice.",

            "Morning Patrol is a 1987 Greek science fiction art film directed by Nikos Nikolaidis. It introduced a new iconography to Nikolaidis' work and contains several elements somewhat resembling the thriller genre and post-apocalyptic science fiction. The film has an elaborate yet simple script of strongly contrasting moods. The film's dialogue contains excerpts taken from published works authored by Daphne du Maurier, Philip K. Dick, Raymond Chandler, and Herman Raucher. It received the Best Director Award and the Greek National Ministry of Culture Award at the Thessaloniki Festival of Greek Cinema in October 1987, where Dinos Katsouridis also won the Best Cinematographer Award and Marie- Louise Bartholomew also won the Best Art Director Award. The film went on further to be officially selected for screening at Fantasporto in February 1989 where it was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award and it was also officially selected for screening at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in January 1987 where it was nominated for the Grand Prize.",
            "Neither Blood nor Sand is a 1941 Mexican comedy film directed by Alejandro Galindo and starring Cantinflas, Susana Gu\u00edzar and Elvia Salcedo. It was intended as a parody of the big-budget Hollywood film\" Blood and Sand\", which portrays the world of bullfighting. It was Cantinflas' second full feature film, and its popularity cemented his rising success. He did not get on well with the film's director, but bonded with his assistant Miguel M. Delgado who became his favourite director and directed many of his films. Cantinflas rapidly followed the film with another success,\" The Unknown Policeman\". The film's sets were designed by the art director Jorge Fernandez.",
            "Alejandro Galindo (January 14, 1906 \u2013 February 1, 1999) was a Mexican screenwriter and film director.",
            "Nikos Georgiou Nikolaidis( 25 October 1939, Athens, Greece \u2013 5 September 2007, Athens, Greece) was a Greek film director, screenwriter, film producer, writer, theatre director, assistant director, record producer, television director, and commercial director. He is usually considered a representative of European avant- garde and experimental art film."

            "Per Allan Magnus Cla\u00ebsson Uggla (pronounced ; born June 18, 1954) is a Swedish artist, composer, actor, and occasional radio host known for his satirical lyrics. Uggla was born in Stockholm. He was the lead singer of the hard rock band JUSO (later renamed Alexander Lucas) before going solo in the early 1970s. Their influences were Black Sabbath, The Groundhogs and Alice Cooper among others. Uggla's first two glam- and art rock-inspired albums \"Om Bobbo Viking\" and \"Livets teater\"\u02c8 didn't sell well, the first only about 500 copies in Sweden and \"Livets teater\" even less. But his departure from glam rock with the punk and hard rock inspired \"Va ska man ta livet av sig f\u00f6r n\u00e4r man \u00e4nd\u00e5 inte f\u00e5r h\u00f6ra snacket efter\u00e5t\" gained him much popularity and the album sold about 150 000 copies. In the 1970s, several music magazines gave Magnus the name \"The Swedish Ian Hunter\". In 1979, he was one of the members in Magnus Uggla Band. Povel Ramel awarded him the Karamelodiktstipendiet in 1991. Uggla's solo influences includes Karl Gerhard, David Bowie, The Clash, Marc Bolan, Wendy Carlos and Mott the Hoople. In an interview with \"Aftonbladet\", he cited The Clash as the greatest band in the world.",
            "\"Jag skiter\" is a song written and recorded by Magnus Uggla for the album \" Va ska man ta livet av sig f\u00f6r n\u00e4r man \u00e4nd\u00e5 inte f\u00e5r h\u00f6ra snacket efter\u00e5t\" in 1977. The song lyrics encourage not to just listen to what other people think about someone, and also tackles the adult society's requests from the adult world. The song caused controversy, though Magnus Uggla himself said he didn't understand why, since the song was written in a humorist way, based on a joke he'd ridden in a [[Nisse Strix] issue], (\"de s\u00e4ger att jag skiter i allt, men det skiter jag i!\"). In 2003, the song was recorded by [[Elin Ek (actress)|Grynet]], releasing it as a single peaking at second position on the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish singles chart]]. This version replaced the lines \"De \u00e4r b\u00f6gar allihopa\" with \"De \u00e4r puckon allihopa\"."

Bernstein was listed after being named in the \"Red Channels\" journal that identified alleged Communists and Communist sympathizers. Because of the blacklist, a number of artists, writers, directors and others were rendered unemployable, having been accused of subversive political activities in support of Communism or of being Communists themselves.",

            "Sir Elton Hercules John (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight; 25 March 1947) is an English singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums. John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the United States, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10 singles, four of which peaked at number two and nine of which reached number one. His tribute single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", rewritten in dedication to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also produced records and occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford F.C. from 1976 to 1987 and from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. Raised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology, an R&B band with whom he played until 1967. He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for artists including Lulu, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US. John has also had success in musical films and theatre, composing for \"The Lion King\" and its stage adaptation, \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\". John has received five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legends award, and the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 49th on its list of 100 influential musicians of the rock and roll era. In 2013, \"Billboard\" ranked him the most successful male solo artist on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists, and third overall, behind the Beatles and Madonna. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1992, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was knighted by Elizabeth II for \"services to music and charitable services\" in 1998. John has performed at a number of royal events, such as the funeral of Princess Diana at Westminster Abbey in 1997, the Party at the Palace in 2002 and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in 2012. John has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 1992, he established the Elton John AIDS Foundation, and a year later he began hosting his annual Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the highest-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. Since its inception, the foundation has raised over \u00a3300 million. John, who announced he was bisexual in 1976 and has been openly gay since 1988, entered into a civil partnership with David Furnish on 21 December 2005; they married after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in 2014. Presenting John with France's highest civilian award, the Legion d'honneur, in 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron called him a \"melodic genius\" and praised his work on behalf of the LGBT community. In 2018, John embarked on a three-year farewell tour.",
            "\"Rock And Roll Madonna\" is a song by Elton John with lyrics written by Bernie Taupin. The song was released as a single in Britain in 1970, where it never charted. It appeared on several bootlegs and rarities compilations, such as 1992's Rare Masters, before it appeared on the 1995 remaster of his \"self-titled album\". The song structure is, as the title says, a rock and roll song. Live-effects have been added, with an audience cheering throughout most of the song, a technique that would be used similarly three years later on Bennie and the Jets. The b-side, \"Grey Seal\", was rerecorded in 1973 for inclusion on John's seventh album \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\". The song was remade in an \"interlude\" version for the 2019 film \"Rocketman\" with star Taron Egerton performing the vocal."

He also produced nearly 80 films between 1933 and 1958. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and died in Los Angeles, California. Richard Fleischer later recalled Berke\" was known as King of the B's. For years and years he had made nothing but pictures with ten or twelve day shooting schedules, minuscule budgets of about$ 100,000 and no stars. Without bothering with editing or any postproduction chores and with short shooting schedules, he was able to squeeze in eight or ten pictures a year. And he was going nuts\". According to Fleischer, Berke eventually pestered RKO executives enough to be assigned an A picture with a long shooting schedule and stars and he still shot it in twelve days."

In addition, he held the thrones of Ethiopia and Albania as Emperor of Ethiopia (1936\u20131943) and King of the Albanians (1939\u20131943). During his reign of nearly 46 years, which began after the assassination of his father Umberto I, the Kingdom of Italy became involved in two world wars. His reign also encompassed the birth, rise, and fall of Italian Fascism and its regime. During World War I, Victor Emmanuel III accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Paolo Boselli and named Vittorio Emanuele Orlando (the \"premier of victory\") in his place. Following the March on Rome, he appointed Benito Mussolini as Prime Minister and later deposed him in 1943 during World War II. Victor Emmanuel abdicated his throne in 1946 in favour of his son Umberto II, hoping to strengthen support for the monarchy against an ultimately successful referendum to abolish it. He then went into exile to Alexandria, Egypt, where he died and was buried the following year in Saint Catherines's Cathedral of Alexandria. His remains were returned in 2017 to rest in Italy, following an agreement between Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He was also called by the Italians \"Sciabolettalittle saber\") due to his height of , or \"Il Re soldato\" (The Soldier King) for having led his country during both world wars.",

It features regular team members Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Jim Dale, Charles Hawtrey and Joan Sims. French actress Dany Robin makes her only Carry on appearance in Do n't Lose Your Head. It was released in March 1967. Set in France and England in 1789 during the French Revolution, it is a parody of Baroness Orczy's\" The Scarlet Pimpernel\". The first\" Carry On\" to be produced by the Rank Organisation,\" Do n't Lose Your Head\" was not conceived as a part of the series and was first released without the\" Carry On\" prefix. However the ongoing popularity of the series persuaded Rank to add the prefix to this and the following film,\" Follow That Camel\", when they were re-released.",

The funding and distribution came from Roger Corman's New World Pictures which also provided the leading players from among a number of American actors who regularly appeared in such features. It was produced and directed by Cirio H. Santiago who, between 1973 and his death in 2008, partnered with Corman on over 40 Philippines-based action-adventure exploitation films which took advantage of much lower local production costs. The title role is played by top-billed James Iglehart, with co-stars Lada Edmund, Jr. and Carol Speed. As in most such productions of the 1970s and 1980s, the setting is not identified as the Philippines, but rather an unspecified Latin American location ruled by a military-based authoritarian regime. The soundtrack is by Don Julian."

            "Le tigre se parfume \u00e0 la dynamite (Our Agent Tiger) is a 1965 secret agent spy film directed by Claude Chabrol and starring and written by Roger Hanin as the Tiger. It is a sequel to the 1964 film \"Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche\".",
            "Claude Henri Jean Chabrol (24 June 1930 \u2013 12 September 2010) was a French film director and a member of the French New Wave (\"nouvelle vague\") group of filmmakers who first came to prominence at the end of the 1950s. Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean-Luc Godard, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\" before beginning his career as a film maker. Chabrol's career began with \"Le Beau Serge\" (1958), inspired by Hitchcock's \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in \"Les Biches\" (1968), \"La Femme infid\u00e8le\" (1969), and \"Le Boucher\" (1970) \u2013 all featuring St\u00e9phane Audran, who was his wife at the time. Sometimes characterized as a \"mainstream\" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half-century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in \"Violette Nozi\u00e8re\". On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful \"Madame Bovary\" (1991) and \"La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie\" (1996). Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that \"there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper, if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium... Some of his films become almost private jokes, made to amuse himself.\" James Monaco has called Chabrol \"the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave, and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we don't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard.\""

When her troupe returns to Spain, however, she is drawn back to her true calling as a dancer and her aristocratic lover reluctantly allows her to go free. Damita's performance was particularly praised, as was the cinematography of Otto Kanturek who had done location shooting in Barcelona."

            "Caroline at Midnight is a 1994 romantic/ thriller film, written by Travis Rink and directed by Scott McGinnis.",
            "The Naked Brothers Band is an 2007 American children's musical comedy film written and directed by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The film is emboldened by Nat's band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends Joshua Kaye, Thomas Batuello, and David Levi, who all portray themselves. It also includes Allie DiMeco as Nat's fictional female interest, the siblings' real- life cousin Jesse Draper as the group's babysitter, Draper's husband Michael Wolff playing his sons' widowed accordion- playing dad, and real life friends Cooper Pillot and Cole Hawkins portraying the other members of the band. Draper shot the film in the style of a mockumentary \u2014 a parody in documentary format\u2014that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, yet one song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot. In late 2005, Polly Draper, known for her role in\" Thirtysomething\", and her jazz musician husband Michael Wolff entered the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival, where it won the audience award. Former Nickelodeon president Albie Hecht attended the screening and purchased the movie, in association with his Worldwide Biggies label. It became the pilot for the subsequent Nickelodeon show of the same name, airing in the United States on January 27, 2007. The series was created and produced by Draper and premiered in February 2007, to the channel's highest ratings in seven years for viewers in the 6\u201311 age group.",

A fan of film since young age, Lenzi studied at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia and made his first film in 1958 which went unreleased, while his official debut happened in 1961 with \"Queen of the Seas\". Lenzi's films of the 1960s followed popular trends of the era, which led to him directing several spy and erotic thriller films. He followed in suit in the 1970s making \"giallo\" films, crime films and making the first Italian cannibal film with \"Man from the Deep River\". He continued making films up until the 1990s and later worked as a novelist writing a series of murder mysteries.",

            "Chouans! is a 1988 French historical adventure film directed by Philippe de Broca and starring Sophie Marceau, Philippe Noiret, and Lambert Wilson. Based on the 1829 novel \"Les Chouans\" by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, the film is about a woman who must choose between two brothers on opposite sides of the French Civil War of 1793. For her performance in the film, Sophie Marceau received the Cabourg Romantic Film Festival Award for Best Actress.",
            "Philippe de Broca (15 March 1933 \u2013 26 November 2004) was a French movie director. He directed 30 full-length feature films, including the highly successful \"That Man from Rio (\"L'Homme de Rio, \" The Man from Acapulco (Le Magnifique)\" and \"On Guard (Le Bossu)\". His works include historical, romantic epics such as \"Chouans!\" and \"King of Hearts (Le Roi de c\u0153ur)\", as well as comedies with a charismatic, breezy hero ready to embark upon any adventure which comes his way, so long as it means escaping everyday modern life: \"Practice Makes Perfect ( Le Cavaleur)The Devil by the Tail (Le Diable par la queue)The African (L'Africain)\". He had links with the actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, with whom he made six films, as well as with Jean-Pierre Cassel, Philippe Noiret and Jean Rochefort."

            "\"A House Without Love\" is a song composed by Hank Williams. It was released as the B-side to \"Why Don't You Love Me\" in 1950 on MGM Records.",
            "Hiram \"Hank\" Williams (September 17, 1923 \u2013 January 1, 1953) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century, Williams recorded 35 singles (five released posthumously) that reached the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Country & Western Best Sellers chart, including 11 that ranked number one (three posthumously). Born in Mount Olive, Butler County, Alabama, Williams relocated to Georgiana with his family, where he met Rufus Payne, an African American blues musician, who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money. Payne had a major influence on Williams' later musical style, along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb. Williams would later relocate to Montgomery, where he began his music career in 1937, when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15-minute program. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II, Williams had trouble with their replacements, and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse. Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard, who was his manager for nearly a decade. After recording \"Never Again\" and \"Honky Tonkin'\" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. In 1947, he released \"Move It on Over\", which became a hit, and also joined the \"Louisiana Hayride\" radio program. One year later, he released a cover of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, which carried him into the mainstream of music. After an initial rejection, Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree. Among the hits he wrote were \"Your Cheatin' HeartHey, Good Lookin'\", and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Years of back pain, alcoholism and prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health. In 1952 he divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse. On New Year's Day 1953, he died suddenly while traveling to a concert in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 29. Despite his short life, Williams is one of the most celebrated and influential popular musicians of the 20th century, especially in regard to country music. Many artists covered songs Williams wrote and recorded. He influenced Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bob Dylan, George Jones, Charley Pride, and The Rolling Stones, among others. Williams was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1961), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987). The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2010 awarded him a posthumous special citation \"for his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.\""

            "\"Inside Out\" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, included on her seventh studio album \"Femme Fatale\" (2011). It was written by Lukasz Gottwald, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Mathieu Jomphe, Max Martin and Bonnie McKee whilst production was handled by Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Billboard. Musically, \"Inside Out\" is an electropop song that uses elements of dubstep and R&B, and has been compared to Spears' previous material on previous albums \" In the Zone\" and \"Circus\", as well as the work of Madonna. Lyrically, the song has been described as a \"sexy break-up song\", while making references to her previous singles \"... Baby One More Time\" and \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\". The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production. Due to strong digital sales of the album, \"Inside Out\" peaked at number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon International Chart."

            "Abu'l Ghazi Sultan Alqas Mirza , better known as Alqas Mirza (b. 15 March 1516 - d. 9 April 1550), was a Safavid prince and the second son of king (shah) Ismail I (r. 1501\u20131524). In early 1546, with Ottoman help, he staged a revolt against his brother Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576), who was king at the time.",
            "Ismail I (July 17, 1487 \u2013 May 23, 1524), also known as Shah Ismail I , was the founder of the Safavid dynasty, ruling from 1501 to 23 May 1524 as Shah of Iran (Persia). The rule of Ismail is one of the most vital in the history of Iran. Before his accession in 1501, Iran, since its conquest by the Arabs eight-and-a-half centuries before, had not existed as a unified country under native Iranian rule, but had been controlled by a series of Arab caliphs, Turkic sultans, and Mongol khans. Although many Iranian dynasties rose to power amidst this whole period, it was only under the Buyids that a vast part of Iran proper came under Iranian rule (945-1055). The dynasty founded by Ismail I would rule for over two centuries, being one of the greatest Iranian empires and at its height being amongst the most powerful empires of its time, ruling all of present-day Iran, Azerbaijan Republic, Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of modern-day Syria, Turkey, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. It also reasserted the Iranian identity in large parts of Greater Iran. The legacy of the Safavid Empire was also the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy, its architectural innovations and its patronage for fine arts. One of his first actions, was the proclamation of the Twelver sect of Shia Islam to be the official religion of his newly-formed state, which had major consequences for the ensuing history of Iran. Furthermore, this drastic act also gave him a political benefit of separating the growing Safavid state from its strong Sunni neighbors\u2014the Ottoman Empire to the west and the Uzbek confederation to the east. However, it brought into the Iranian body politic the implied inevitability of consequent conflict between the shah, the design of a \"secular\" state, and the religious leaders, who saw all secular states as unlawful and whose absolute ambition was a theocratic state. Ismail was also a prolific poet who, under the pen name Kha\u1e6d\u0101\u02be\u012b (which means \"he who made a mistake\" or \"he who was wrong\" in Persian), contributed greatly to the literary development of the Azerbaijani language. He also contributed to Persian literature, though few of his Persian writings survive."

            "George Harrison (25 February 1943 \u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"TaxmanWithin You Without YouWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHere Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\". Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album \"All Things Must Pass\", a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978. Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. \" Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004. Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his Friar Park home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost \u00a3100 million.",
            "\"Living in the Material World\" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison that was released as the title track of his 1973 album. In the song's lyrics, Harrison contrasts the world of material concerns with his commitment to a spiritual path, and the conflict is further represented in the musical arrangement as the rock accompaniment alternates with sections of Indian sounds. Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation, and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith. The contrasts presented in \"Living in the Material World\" inspired the Last Supper-style photograph by Ken Marcus that appeared inside the album's gatefold cover, and also designer Tom Wilkes's incorporation of Krishna-related symbolism elsewhere in the packaging. Harrison references his Beatles past as one of the trappings of the material world and refers by name to each of his three former bandmates. Ringo Starr, the Beatles' former drummer, plays drums on the track, which was recorded in England between October 1972 and February 1973. The rock portions include a slide guitar solo by Harrison, saxophone solos, two drummers, and prominent Hammond organ, while the meditative Indian interludes feature flute, tabla and a rare post-Beatle sitar contribution from Harrison. Jim Horn, Gary Wright and Zakir Hussain are among the other musicians on the recording. The production and musicianship on the track has received favourable comments from several reviewers. On release, Stephen Holden of \"Rolling Stone\" described the song as \"an incantatory, polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto-on-sitar refrain\". In addition to providing the title for the \"Living in the Material World\" album, it inspired Harrison's choice for a name for his charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation, to which he donated his publishing royalties from the composition. The 2006 reissue of the album includes a film clip of \"Living in the Material World\", featuring archival footage of the vinyl LP's manufacturing process. Film-maker Martin Scorsese used the song's title for that of his 2011 ."

He was known to the Siamese of his time as \"Phra Phuttha Chao Luang\" (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07, the Royal Buddha). His reign was characterized by the modernization of Siam, governmental and social reforms, and territorial concessions to the British and French. As Siam was threatened by Western expansionism, Chulalongkorn, through his policies and acts, managed to save Siam from colonization. All his reforms were dedicated to ensuring Siam's survival in the face of Western colonialism, so that Chulalongkorn earned the epithet \"Phra Piya Maharat\" (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a, the Great Beloved King).",

She was the eldest daughter and the third child of King Chulalongkorn and Queen Savang Vadhana together. She was given the full name by her father as, \"Vichitra Chiraprabha Adulyadirekratana Khattiyarajakumari\" She died in infancy on 15 August 1881, at the age of 3 months."

            "Vernon Campbell Sewell (4 July 1903 \u2013 21 June 2001) was a British film director, writer, producer and, briefly, an actor. Sewell was born in London, England, and was educated at Marlborough College. He directed more than 30 films during his career, starting with \"Morgenrot\" (1933) and ending with \"Burke & Hare\" (1971). He worked chiefly in B-movies, some of which were, according to the BFI Screenonline, \"well above the usual cut-price standards of film-making at this level.\" He was married to the actress Joan Carol. Vernon Sewell died on 21 June 2001 in Durban, South Africa, at age 97.",
            "Home and Away is a 1956 British second feature drama film directed by Vernon Sewell and starring Jack Warner and Kathleen Harrison. It depicts the life of an ordinary working-class man after he wins the football pools. The film reunited Warner and Harrison who had previously appeared together in the Huggetts series of films."

It is starred and produced by Alain Delon. In France and Germany it runs less than the Italian cut. It is known and available on DVD in France as\" Le Professeur\"( The Professor) and in Germany as\" Oktober in Rimini\"( October in Rimini). It tells the story of a gifted but restless young man who can not live up to the high traditions of his family and survives in obscurity, taking casual teaching jobs and living in a loveless partnership with a depressed woman. His aimless existence reaches a crisis point when he falls for one of his pupils, a beautiful but badly damaged girl.",

            "Richard Georg Strauss (11 June 1864 \u2013 8 September 1949) was a German composer, conductor, pianist, and violinist. Considered a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras, he has been described as a successor of Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Along with Gustav Mahler, he represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. Strauss's compositional output began in 1870 when he was just six years old and lasted until his death nearly eighty years later. While his output of works encompasses nearly every type of classical compositional form, Strauss achieved his greatest success with tone poems and operas. His first tone poem to achieve wide acclaim was \"Don Juan\" (1889), and this was followed by other lauded works of this kind, including \"Death and Transfiguration\" (1890), \"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks\" (1895), \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" (1896), \"Don Quixote\" (1897), \"Ein Heldenleben\" (1898), \"Symphonia Domestica\" (1905), and \"An Alpine Symphony\" (1915). His first opera to achieve international fame was \"Salome\" (1905) which used a libretto by Hedwig Lachmann that was a German translation of the French play \"Salom\u00e9\" by Oscar Wilde. This was followed by several critically acclaimed operas with librettist Hugo von Hofmannsthal: \"Elektra\" (1909), \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1911), \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" (1912, rev. 1916), \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" (1919), \"Die \u00e4gyptische Helena\" (1928), and \"Arabella\" (1933). His last operas, \"Daphne\" (1938), \"Friedenstag\" (1938), \"Die Liebe der Danae\" (1940) and \"Capriccio\" (1942) used libretti written by Joseph Gregor, the Viennese theatre historian. Other well-known works by Strauss include two symphonies, lieder (especially his \"Four Last Songs\" from 1948), the Violin Concerto in D minor (1882), the Horn Concerto No. 1 (1883), Horn Concerto No. 2 (1943), his Oboe Concerto and other instrumental works such as \"Metamorphosen\" (1945). Strauss was also a prominent conductor in Western Europe and the Americas, enjoying quasi-celebrity status as his compositions became standards of orchestral and operatic repertoire. He was chiefly admired for his interpretations of the works of Liszt, Mozart, and Wagner in addition to his own works. A conducting disciple of Hans von B\u00fclow , Strauss began his conducting career as B\u00fclow's assistant with the Meiningen Court Orchestra in 1883. After B\u00fclow resigned in 1885, Strauss served as that orchestra's primary conductor for five months before being appointed to the conducting staff of the Bavarian State Opera where he worked as third conductor from 1886\u20131889. He then served as principal conductor of the Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar from 1889\u20131894. In 1894 he made his conducting debut at the Bayreuth Festival, conducting Wagner's \"Tannh\u00e4user\" with his wife, soprano Pauline de Ahna, singing Elisabeth. He then returned to the Bavarian State Opera, this time as principal conductor, from 1894\u20131898, after which he was principal conductor of the Berlin State Opera from 1898\u20131913. From 1919\u20131924 he was principal conductor of the Vienna State Opera, and in 1920 he co-founded the Salzburg Festival. In addition to these posts, Strauss was a frequent guest conductor in opera houses and with orchestras internationally. In 1933 Strauss was appointed to two important positions in the musical life of Nazi Germany: head of the Reichsmusikkammer and principal conductor of the Bayreuth Festival. The latter role he accepted after conductor Arturo Toscanini had resigned from the position in protest of the Nazi party. These positions have led some to criticize Strauss for his seeming collaboration with the Nazis. However, Strauss's daughter-in-law, Alice Grab Strauss [n\u00e9e von Hermannsw\u00f6rth], was Jewish and much of his apparent acquiescence to the Nazi Party was done in order to save her life, and the lives of her children (his grandchildren). He was also apolitical, and took the Reichsmusikkammer post in order to advance copyright protections for composers, attempting as well to preserve performances of works by banned composers such as Debussy, Mahler, and Mendelssohn. Further, Strauss insisted on using a Jewish librettist, Stefan Zweig, for his opera \"Die schweigsame Frau\" (1935) which ultimately led to his firing from the Reichsmusikkammer and Bayreuth. His opera \"Friedenstag\", which premiered just before the outbreak of World War II, was a thinly veiled criticism of the Nazi party that attempted to persuade Germans to abandon violence for peace. Thanks to his influence, his daughter-in-law was placed under protected house arrest during the war, but despite extensive efforts he was unable to save dozens of his in-laws from being killed in Nazi concentration camps. In 1948, a year before his death, he was cleared of any wrong doing by a denazification tribunal in Munich.",
            "\"C\u00e4cilie\", Op. 27 No. 2, is the second in a set of four songs composed by Richard Strauss in 1894. The words are from a love poem \"C\u00e4cilie\" written by Heinrich Hart (1855\u20131906), a German dramatic critic and journalist who also wrote poetry. It was written for the poet's wife C\u00e4cilie.\n, or UK English as \"Cecilia\"."

He was born in Scotland, in Altyre, Moray in 1163 and died in Buchan in 1233 where he is buried in Deer Abbey. William made his fortune in the service of King William I of Scotland fighting the Meic Uilleim in the north. William witnesses no fewer than 88 charters of the king. William was sheriff of Forfar (1195\u20131211), Justiciar of Scotia (1205\u20131233) and warden of Moray (1211\u20132). Between 1199 and 1200, William was sent to England to discuss important matters on King William's behalf with the new king, John. William was appointed to the prestigious office of Justiciar of Scotia, the most senior royal office in the kingdom, in 1205. Between 1211 and 1212, William, as Warden of Moray (or \"Guardian of Moray\") fought against the insurgency of Gofraid mac Domnaill (of the Meic Uilleim family), whom William beheaded in Kincardine in 1213. Upon finally destroying the Meic Uilleim's in 1229, he was given the Lordship of Badenoch and the lands it controlled. From an unknown date, William held the title Lord of Kilbride. He helped oversee the construction of St Mungo's Cathedral in Glasgow and after his death, Marjory continued his work there.",

            "Vincente Minnelli (February 28, 1903 \u2013 July 25, 1986) was an American stage director and film director. He directed the classic movie musicals \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (1944), \"An American in Paris\" (1951), \"The Band Wagon\" (1953), and \"Gigi\" (1958). \" An American in Paris\" and \"Gigi\" both won the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Minnelli winning Best Director for \"Gigi\". In addition to having directed some of the best known musicals of his day, Minnelli made many comedies and melodramas. He was married to Judy Garland from 1945 until 1951; the couple were the parents of Liza Minnelli.",
            "Two Weeks in Another Town is a 1962 American drama film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Kirk Douglas, Edward G. Robinson, Cyd Charisse, Claire Trevor, Daliah Lavi, George Hamilton, and Rosanna Schiaffino. It was based on a novel by Irwin Shaw. The film depicts the shooting of a romantic costume drama in Rome by a team of decadent Hollywood stars, during the Hollywood on the Tiber era. It contains several references to a previous successful Minnelli movie, \"The Bad and the Beautiful,\" also starring Douglas. The story was seen by some as a reelaboration of the past relationship between actors Tyrone Power and Linda Christian and producer Darryl Zanuck. At the time of its release, the film was seen as a box office failure with overall losses of approximately three million dollars."

He was frequently seen on television with his troupe David Winters Dancers in various variety shows most notably\" Hullabaloo\" where he was the first to choreograph the Watusi, originated the Freddy, and popularized several dances in the 1960s. He was a common collaborator of Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret including their hit film\" Viva Las Vegas\". Other dance choreography credits include\" T.A.M.I. ShowSend Me No FlowersBillieA Star Is Born\", and more. For the TV movie\" Movin' with Nancy\", he is noted to be the first dance choreographer to be nominated in the history of the Emmys in the category Special Classification of Individual Achievements before the category Outstanding Achievement in Choreography( for which he was also nominated) was created. He eventually became a director and a producer starting with a streak of star- studded TV specials including\" Raquel!\" and\" Once Upon a Wheel\". His first theatrical release was the concert film it is noted for imaginative costumes and set. He also directed\" The Last Horror Film.\" It was Joe Spinell's second lead role and his last collaboration with Caroline Munro. Another directorial effort was the teenage romance skateboarding film\" Thrashin\", starring Josh Brolin in his first lead. In the mid 1980s, Winters opened his own production and distribution company, Action International Pictures, within this enterprise he mostly produced for other directors, a number of them by directed by David A. Prior starring his brother Ted. Some of these cult classics include\" Deadly PreyAerobicideSpace Mutiny\", and\" Mankillers.\" From then on he specialized in action- oriented films many with recurring actors such as Robert Ginty, David Carradine, Robert Davi, Jan- Michael Vincent, Cameron Mitchell, and Oliver Reed. From 2000 to 2019, Winters remained an active member of the film industry. Some of these efforts includes acting in mini series\" Blackbeard\" with Angus Macfadyen, and Jessica Chastain and the Sundance winner\" Teddy Bear,\" as well as producing the historical epic\" The King Maker\" with Gary Stretch and John Rhys Davies.

            "Cohasset is a house in northeastern Hampton County, South Carolina about north of Hampton, South Carolina near the unincorporated community of Crocketville. It was built about 1873. It is north of U.S. Route 601. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1986.",
            "Icon Norfolk is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of Downtown Norfolk, Virginia, United States. The building was the tallest in the state of Virginia from 1967 to 1971, when it was overtaken by Richmond City Hall. Today, it is the second- tallest building in City of Norfolk. The tower was constructed in 1965- 67 and designed by Skidmore, Owings& Merrill, one of Virginia's leading architectural firms of the period. It has a long history in banking. Built as the original headquarters for Virginia National Bank( VNB), the building retained headquarters status for Sovran Bank, formed from the merger of VNB and First& Merchants Bank of Richmond in 1983. After a series of mergers beginning in 1990( including NationsBank), the building became the regional office for its namesake Bank of America in 1998. In 2010, local reports were published of the building losing tenants, especially to newer office towers in Downtown Norfolk, such as the Wells Fargo Center. However, shipping company Maersk Line Limited retained its headquarters in the building. In late 2015, plans were announced to convert the building to a 300- unit luxury apartment tower with ground- level retail. The building was renamed Icon Norfolk, part of a larger project known as CityWalk which will also entail redeveloping an adjacent office building at 2 Commercial Place. In August 2016, Bank of America announced its intent to relocate its offices( and its building- top signage) to the 999 Waterside Drive, the former Dominion Tower, a few blocks away. The tower has now been completely remodeled into Icon Norfolk apartments, and the address has been changed to 321 E. Main Street."

            "Goldsborough is a village and civil parish in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire, England. It is situated near the River Nidd and 1 mile east of Knaresborough. Goldsborough is recognised by the well- known stately home Goldsborough Hall and its other features including: Goldsborough Primary School, the Bay Horse Inn and the Goldsborough Cricket Grounds. The village appears in the Domesday Book as Golburg or Goldeburgh, which means Golda's Burgh( with Burgh meaning borough). It was in the possession of the de Goldesburgh, Hutton and Byerley families at that time. A Viking hoard was discovered in Goldsborough Village in 1859 during construction outside the north wall of Goldsborough Church. Coins and artefacts dating from 700 to 1050 were found in a leaden chest including fragments of Viking brooches and arm rings, together with 39 coins. It forms one of the largest collections ever discovered in the UK and is now held at the British Museum in London. The village has a Church of England affiliated primary school which takes pupils from the surrounding settlements of Allerton, Coneythorpe, Hopperton and Flaxby. The church in the village, the Church of St Mary the Virgin, was the setting for the baptism of George Henry Hubert Lascelles, first cousin of Queen Elisabeth II. the baptism was attended by King George V and Queen Mary. Their daughter, Princess Mary, had married Viscount Henry Lascelles in 1922 and their eldest son was the King and Queen's first grandchild. Goldsborough was used by Yorkshire Television in the filming of\" The New Statesman\". Goldsborough used to have a railway station on the Harrogate to York railway line. The station was located north east of the village. The site is where the current A59 passes over the railway line. The village has one pub; The Bay Horse Inn.",

            "Irving Howe( June 11, 1920 \u2013 May 5, 1993) was an American literary and social critic and a prominent figure of the Democratic Socialists of America.",
            "Arthur Biedl (4 October 1869 \u2013 26 August 1933) was a Hungarian pathologist born in what today is Comlo\u015fu Mic, Romania. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, and from 1893 served as an assistant to Salomon Stricker (1834-1898), Philipp Knoll (1841-1900) and Richard Paltauf (1858-1924) at the institute of experimental pathology in Vienna. In 1899 he became an associate professor, followed by a full professorship in 1902. In 1898, Biedl and colleague R. Kraus demonstrated that \"bile salts,\" when injected into the bloodstream of animals, failed to elicit a behavioral change. They hypothesized that this was due to a semipermeable membrane that protected the central nervous system from the passive diffusion of solutes in the bloodstream. Two years later, Max Lewandowsky coined the term \"Blood\u2013brain barrier\" when these findings were confirmed with other biological compounds. Edwin Goldmann and his mentor Paul Ehrlich further confirmed these findings with aniline dyes injected inside and outside of the brain. He is considered a founder of modern endocrinology. In 1910, Biedl published a landmark textbook on endocrinology called \"Innere Sekretion\" (Internal Secretions), which was a thorough study on glands and their secretions. In 1922, he described his studies of two sisters who had retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, hypogonadism as well as obesity. Two years earlier Georges Bardet (1885\u20131966) at the University of Paris described the same symptoms in two sisters unrelated to Biedl's findings. This syndrome is now called the Bardet-Biedl syndrome after the two men. A similar disease was originally named the \"Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl syndrome\", together with two English physicians, John Zachariah Laurence (1829\u20131870) and Robert Charles Moon (1845\u20131914). Today this disease has been shortened to become the Laurence-Moon syndrome, while the Bardet-Biedl syndrome is recognized as a separate entity. In 1928 he founded the journal \"Endokrinologie\"."

Priyanka Chopra made a cameo appearance in the song Ram Chahe Leela. Bhansali conceived \"Ram-Leela\" while working on his directional debut ; an insufficient budget led to the project being postponed. After reviving the project in 2012, Singh and Padukone were cast in the lead roles over many other choices. Principal photography began in Gujarat before moving to Rajasthan. Much of the filming was done on sets, despite previous plans against doing so. The background score was composed by Monty Sharma, while the lyrics were written by Siddharth\u2013Garima. The film's release, scheduled on 15 November 2013, was stayed by Delhi High Court. The film initially titled \"Ram-Leela\" was changed to \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" in response to an order by the court, allowing it to release on the scheduled date. It received positive reviews, with praise directed to the performances of the cast members, particularly Singh and Padukone. Criticism was focused on its plot and elements of violence. \"Ram-Leela\" earned 2.2 billion in its theatrical run and emerged as the fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2013 as well as one of the highest-grossing Indian films. \"Ram-Leela\" received 8 nominations at the Filmfare Awards, winning three including Best Actress for Padukone. At the International Indian Film Academy Awards, it received nine nominations, including for Best Film, and won two."

            "Ibrahim Sharif was Bey of Tunis from 1702 to 1705, during the period of crisis which brought an end to the Muradid dynasty and preceded the rise to power of Husayn I Bey. Lieutenant of the Muradid Beys of Tunis, Ibrahim was at various points Agha of the sipahis( commander of the cavalry of the Turkish militia) and Agha of the janissaries( commander of the rifleman) to the final Muradid princes. During a trip to Istanbul to recruit jannissaries, a new war was declared between Murad III Bey and the Dey of Algiers; the Ottoman court, no longer able to control Murad III, ordered Ibrahim to return to Tunisia and arrest him. At the outset of the military campaign, on the banks of the Wadi Zarka, Ibrahim struck Murad III with a blow from his blunderbuss, before killing him in the presence of his other lieutenants. On his return to Tunis Sharif assassinated all the remaining princes of the Muradid dynasty in order to seize power for himself- the two young sons of Muhammad al- Hafsi al- Muradi, second son of Hammouda Pacha Bey, along with Hussein Bey, the third son of Hammouda Pacha Bey and his own son who was only four years old. Proclaimed Bey by the janissary militia, he was the first Bey not to be a Muradid in over a century. He was also designated Pasha by the Ottomans, as a reward for bringing an end to hostilities and subsequently was elected Dey of Tunis by the Ottoman divan of Tunis. He promptly abolished the title and powers of the Dey. Although he had accumulated all the offices at the head of the Tunisian beylik, he did not manage to put an end to the revolts and agitation begun after the death of the last Muradids. After he was defeated by the Dey of Algiers near Kef on 8 July 1705, he was captured and taken to Algiers, which led to the establishment of the Husainid dynasty after his own Agha of the Sipahis, Al- Husayn I ibn Ali at- Turki seized power. On his return to Tunis on 10 July, he was proclaimed Bey of Tunis. Ibrahim, freed by the Dey of Algiers, attempted to retake Tunis in order to avenge himself and regain power, but he was assassinated on the way at the order of Husayn I Bey at Ghar el- Melh. His tomb is located at the foot of the city's fort.",

            "Lecturer Paul Kuniaki Maruyama (born October 27, 1941 in Tokyo) was a member of the first American team to compete in judo in the Summer Olympics. Judo was first included in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Maruyama was born in Kugayama, Tokyo, in 1941, son of Kunio Maruyama and his nisei wife, Mary Takeda. He is a graduate of San Jos\u00e9 State University (B.S.) and of University of Hawaii (M.B.A.). He was the United States national champion in the 154 pound weight class in 1966, 1970 and 1975, and placed second in the open weight class in 1966. At the 1964 Summer Olympics he was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the lightweight competition after losing to gold medalist Takehide Nakatani. He was the coach of the United States judo team for the 1980 Summer Olympics, boycotted by the United States, and for the 1984 Summer Olympics. Maruyama went on to teach martial arts and Japanese language at the United States Air Force Academy, and served as president of the Japan-America Society of Southern Colorado. He teaches Japanese language and Asian Studies at Colorado College. He is a lifelong friend with former teammate, politician Ben Nighthorse Campbell.",

He was one of the three Japanese men who were secretly sent from Hsinking's Japanese Society, that led to the successful repatriation of most of the 1.6 million Japanese who had been trapped in the former Manchukuo at the end of World War II."
