He was one of the prominent 19th-century composers known as The Mighty Handful, a group dedicated to producing a uniquely Russian kind of classical music, rather than imitating earlier Western European models. Borodin is best known for his symphonies, his two string quartets, the tone poem \"\"In the Steppes of Central Asia\"\" and his opera \"\"Prince Igor\"\".

A group of Russian composers\u2014Alexander Borodin, C\u00e9sar Cui, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Anatoly Lyadov\u2014collaboratively composed three-hand piano variations on this theme for Borodin's daughter Gania.

Borodin's music is full of romantic charm and enticing melody, and much of it also rings with the pageantry and landscape of old Russia; of onion-domed churches, richly decorated icons, and the vastness of the land.

The team was composed of English thin man Stan Laurel (1890\u20131965) and American fat man Oliver Hardy (1892\u20131957). They became well known during the late 1920s through the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous bully Hardy. The duo's signature tune is known variously as \"The Cuckoo Song\", \"Ku-Ku\", or \"The Dance of the Cuckoos\". It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats."

Modern English has very little inflection of nouns or adjectives, to the point where some authors describe it as an analytic language, but the Modern English system of personal pronouns has preserved some of the inflectional complexity of Old English and Middle English.

The first person plural pronoun \"\"nu\u00e7na\"\" is equivalent to \"\"we\"\" in English and the second person plural pronoun \"\"kunna\"\" is equivalent to \"\"you all\"\" in English.

Interrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use \"\"who\"\" (subject), \"\"whom\"\" (object) or \"\"whose\"\" (possessive); for example, \"\"Who did that?\"\" In colloquial speech, \"\"whom\"\" is generally replaced by \"\"who\"\".

He noted that gender as a property inherent in nouns (rather than in their referents) is not entirely absent from modern English: different pronouns may be appropriate for the same referent depending on what noun has been used. The third-person singular personal pronouns are chosen according to the natural gender of their antecedent or referent. As a general rule: Pronoun agreement is often with the natural gender of the referent (the person or thing denoted) rather than\nDoc 3(Title: Third-person pronoun) of \"\"he\"\" for referring to a person of unspecified sex, as well as the various alternatives to this convention, see the discussion in the sections below.

The only distinction made is between personal and non-personal reference (\"\"someone\"\" vs. \"\"something\"\", \"\"who\"\" vs. \"\"what\"\", etc.).

The Richard III Society contends that this means that 'a lot of what people thought they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.' The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare's play \"\"Richard III\"\" as a physically deformed, Machiavellian villain, ruthlessly committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare's intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. Rous himself, in his \"\"History of the\nDoc 2(Title: Richard III of England) maternal side was as previously thought. The paternal side, however, demonstrated some variance from what had been expected, with the DNA showing no links to the purported descendants of Richard's great-great-grandfather Edward III of England through Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort. This could be the result of covert illegitimacy that does not reflect the accepted genealogies between Richard and Edward III or between Edward III and the 5th Duke of Beaufort.

Richard actually embodies the dramatic character of \"\"Vice\"\" from medieval morality plays\u2014with which Shakespeare was very familiar from his time\u2014with his \"\"impish-to-fiendish humour\"\". Like Vice, Richard is able to render what is ugly and evil\u2014his thoughts and aims, his view of other characters\u2014into what is charming and amusing for the audience. In the earlier acts of the play, too, the role of the antagonist is filled\nDoc 2(Title: Phantom (Sword of Truth)) that he understands the situations, but Shota remains unconvinced and touches him with her power, opening his mind to see a vision that places Richard in the position of the slaughtered men of Ebissinia, who are condemned to death while listening to the vulgar promises of what the soldiers will do to their wives. In this dream-like reality, Richard sees Kahlan begging for his life and they profess their love for each other. As Nicci and Shota have a minor confrontation, Richard realizes that Shota is right. Despite how important Kahlan's life is to him, it is only one life,\nDoc 3(Title: Richard III (play)) Clarence as a necessary step to get there.

Scholar Michael E.

According to the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", he is \"widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century\". Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" cautions, \"his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification\".",
            "Loewald's father, who died shortly after his birth, was a Jewish physician with an interest in dermatology and psychiatry; his mother a gifted musician, who played the piano. Loewald did medical training in Germany - where he also studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger, who would influence him with his theory of language - before taking a medical degree from Rome University in 1935. He practised psychiatry in Italy until 1939, before moving with his family to the United States. There he became fascinated by Freud\u2019s theory, in which he rooted all the features of his own thinking. He did not want to create a new psychoanalytic terminology, but, although he used Freud\u2019s terms, he gave them radically new meanings."

He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album (\"TheFutureEmbrace\") and a collection of poetry (\"Blinking with Fists\") before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins."

The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of \"Jean de Florette\", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to \"Reassuringly Elephants\"). They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture."

Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred.

The defining features of personhood and consequently what makes a person count as a person differ widely among cultures and contexts.

Vice versa, if the interpreter knew what a person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred.

Also referred to as the \"Stovepipe\", the innovative bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a \"bazooka\" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns."

It gradually strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. As it neared landfall in Puerto Rico early on July 18, upper-level winds weakened it back to a tropical depression. Claudette remained disorganized and the National Hurricane Center operationally reported that it degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. Late on July 18, the depression struck Dominican Republic, emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. Claudette struck western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and \"regenerating\" into a tropical cyclone. By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border late on July 23 as a moderately strong tropical storm. It weakened slowly and drifted over land, lasting until dissipation in West Virginia on July 29."

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.

            "Bae Doo-na (; ] ; born October 11, 1979) is a South Korean actress and photographer.

She has had English-speaking roles in the Wachowski films \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012) and \"Jupiter Ascending\" (2015), and the TV series \"Sense8\" (2015-present).",
            "Cloud Atlas is a 2012 German-American science fiction film written and directed by The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer. Adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name by David Mitchell, the film has multiple plots set across six different eras, which Mitchell described as \"a sort of pointillist mosaic.\" The official synopsis describes it as \"an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.\" Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Jim Broadbent lead an ensemble cast."
