The team was composed of English thin man Stan Laurel (1890\u20131965) and American fat man Oliver Hardy (1892\u20131957). They became well known during the late 1920s through the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous bully Hardy. The duo's signature tune is known variously as \"The Cuckoo Song\", \"Ku-Ku\", or \"The Dance of the Cuckoos\". It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats."

            "Martin Heidegger ( ; ] ; 26 September 188926 May 1976) was a German philosopher and a seminal thinker in the Continental tradition and philosophical hermeneutics. According to the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", he is \"widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century\". Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" cautions, \"his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification\".",
            "Loewald's father, who died shortly after his birth, was a Jewish physician with an interest in dermatology and psychiatry; his mother a gifted musician, who played the piano. Loewald did medical training in Germany - where he also studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger, who would influence him with his theory of language - before taking a medical degree from Rome University in 1935. He practised psychiatry in Italy until 1939, before moving with his family to the United States. There he became fascinated by Freud\u2019s theory, in which he rooted all the features of his own thinking. He did not want to create a new psychoanalytic terminology, but, although he used Freud\u2019s terms, he gave them radically new meanings."

In 2008 \"The Times\" named Chatwin #46 on their list of \"50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945.\"",

CC's are predominantly sold in Australia and come in assorted flavours. CC's were also sold in New Zealand until Bluebird Foods (the owner of the CC's brand in New Zealand) decided to locally produce the American brand Doritos in March 2010. The chips are made of ground corn, vegetable oil, and seasoning. The full ingredients list is vegetable oils (sunflower, palmolein), milk solids (cheese powder), food acids (270, 330, 331), flavour enhancers (621, 627, 631), starch (wheat, maize), vegetable powders (onion, tomato, garlic), salt, sugar, herbs, spice (cumin), flavour (natural and nature identical), yeast extract, vegetable extract (soy, wheat), antioxidants (304, 306).",

            "Seth Edward Putnam (May 15, 1968 \u2013 June 11, 2011) was an American musician who was the founder of grindcore band Anal Cunt. He was known for his brutal screaming and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke morbid humor. Throughout his career, Putnam had been involved in many side projects, including backing vocals on Pantera's \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\"",
            "William Patrick \"Billy\" Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and entrepreneur. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album (\"TheFutureEmbrace\") and a collection of poetry (\"Blinking with Fists\") before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins."

            "Jean de Florette (] ) is a 1986 French period drama film directed by Claude Berri, based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol. It is followed by \"Manon des Sources\". The film takes place in rural Provence, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. The film starred three of France's most prominent actors \u2013 G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, who won a BAFTA award for his performance, and Yves Montand in one of his last roles before his death.",
            "Reassuringly Expensive was the Stella Artois' advertising slogan in the United Kingdom from 1982 until 2007. The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of \"Jean de Florette\", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to \"Reassuringly Elephants\"). They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture."

Goodenow was born in Henniker, New Hampshire and was primarily self-educated, though he did graduate from Dartmouth College. He studied law under future U.S. Senator John Holmes and was admitted to the York County, Maine Bar in 1817. Residing in Alfred, Maine, Goodenow served three one year terms in the Maine House of Representatives (1827, 1828 and 1830), which included a term as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. He was a member of the National Republican Party while in the Legislature. In 1831, Goodenow was the Whig Party candidate for Governor. Unsuccessful, he ran again in 1832 and 1833. In 1838 and 1841, Goodenow served as Maine Attorney General."

            "Bazooka is the common name for a man-portable recoilless anti-tank rocket launcher weapon, widely fielded by the United States Army. Also referred to as the \"Stovepipe\", the innovative bazooka was among the first generation of rocket-propelled anti-tank weapons used in infantry combat. Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a \"bazooka\" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns."

The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was slightly below average, with nine systems reaching tropical storm intensity. The first system, an unnumbered tropical depression, developed north of Puerto Rico on June 9. Two days later, Tropical Depression One formed and produced severe flooding in Jamaica, with 40 deaths and about $27 million (1979 USD) in damage. Tropical Storm Ana caused minimal impact in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Bob spawned tornadoes and produced minor wind damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States, primarily in Louisiana, while the remnants caused flooding, especially in Indiana. Tropical Storm Claudette caused extensive flooding, due to torrential rainfall. There were two deaths and damaged totaled $750 million.",
            "Tropical Storm Claudette caused significant flooding in eastern Texas and western Louisiana in July 1979. The third named storm of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, Claudette developed from a tropical wave located east of the Windward Islands on July 16. It gradually strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. As it neared landfall in Puerto Rico early on July 18, upper-level winds weakened it back to a tropical depression. Claudette remained disorganized and the National Hurricane Center operationally reported that it degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. Late on July 18, the depression struck Dominican Republic, emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. Claudette struck western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and \"regenerating\" into a tropical cyclone. By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border late on July 23 as a moderately strong tropical storm. It weakened slowly and drifted over land, lasting until dissipation in West Virginia on July 29."

He is best remembered for briefly being the Democratic vice presidential nominee under George McGovern in 1972. He suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life, resulting in several hospitalizations, which were kept secret from the public. When they were revealed it humiliated the McGovern campaign and Eagleton was forced to quit the race. He later became adjunct professor of public affairs at Washington University in St. Louis.",
            "Robert Skinner Boyd (born January 11, 1928) is an American journalist who spent most of his career working for the Knight Newspaper Group, spending two decades as the group's Washington bureau chief. He and Clark Hoyt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for uncovering the fact that Senator Thomas Eagleton, George McGovern's choice for vice president, had had severe psychiatric problems and undergone three shock treatments. Instead of publishing their scoop, they disclosed their findings to McGovern's top advisor, and Eagleton withdrew as the Democratic nominee."

            "Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 \u2013 February 16, 1998) was an American toxicologist and public health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying the effects of the 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards the end of her life she received numerous awards and accolades.",
            "The 1948 Donora smog was a historic air inversion that resulted in a wall of smog that killed 20 people and sickened 7,000 more in Donora, Pennsylvania, a mill town on the Monongahela River, 24 mi southeast of Pittsburgh. The event is commemorated by the Donora Smog Museum."

She has had English-speaking roles in the Wachowski films \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012) and \"Jupiter Ascending\" (2015), and the TV series \"Sense8\" (2015-present).",

Adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name by David Mitchell, the film has multiple plots set across six different eras, which Mitchell described as \"a sort of pointillist mosaic.\" The official synopsis describes it as \"an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.\" Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Jim Broadbent lead an ensemble cast."

The Blackstone River Valley was the site of some of the earliest successful textile mills in the United States, and these mills contributed significantly to the earliest American Industrial Revolution. The subsequent construction of the Blackstone Canal, a few years after the successful completion of the Erie Canal, helped to sustain the region's industrial strength.",

Originally, it ran 363 mi from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie. It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States."

She was sentenced to death but this was reduced on the grounds of her gender. In December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons, though she did not take her seat and, along with the other Sinn F\u00e9in TDs, formed the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. She was also the second woman in the world to hold a cabinet position (Minister for Labour of the Irish Republic, 1919\u20131922)."

Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the monarchy and introduced far-reaching land reforms the following year. Following a 1954 attempt on his life by a Muslim Brotherhood member, he cracked down on the organization, put President Muhammad Naguib under house arrest, and assumed executive office, officially becoming president in June 1956.",

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Faruq. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment."

            "The Vincent Black Shadow (also known as TVBS) is an alternative rock band that was signed to the Bodog record label in 2006 and to Beef Records in 2008. Originally consisting of Cassandra Ford on vocals, brothers Rob Kirkham on guitar, Anthony Kirkham on drums, and Chris Kirkham (a.k.a. Nim Vind) on bass, with Mary Ancheta on keyboards. As of 2010, Nikki Hurst replaced Ford as lead vocalist when Ford expressed interest in taking a break to go to school. The new line up however remained the same and Ford decided to work on other musical projects minus the Kirkham brothers. The name is derived from the motorcycle of the same name, the Vincent Black Shadow. \"Fears in the Water\" was first released on July 11, 2006, and their sophomore effort, \"El Monstruo\", on September 15, 2008. Their latest creation, an EP entitled \"The Finest Crime\" was released via iTunes on Valentine's Day 2011."

            "Turpinite, also called Turpenite, is a fictional war gas allegedly developed by the French chemist Eug\u00e8ne Turpin and deployed against the attacking German army during the first months of World War I. According to contemporary accounts, Turpinite, delivered by artillery shells, silently and suddenly killed any person within 400 yd of impact with its fumes. Survivors of Turpinite barrages reported a strong chemical smell after an attack. In reality, this smell was a side effect of the explosives used by the French and British militaries during the war. The widespread, sudden deaths caused by artillery were in many cases caused by concussion, which leaves no mark on the victim. After the war, German scientist Fritz Haber, who pioneered German gas attacks at the Second Battle of Ypres, said German soldiers had reported a strong chemical smell attributed to turpenite. Haber and others investigated, finding the smell was due to incomplete combustion of the picric acid used in British artillery shells. The belief that the French used chemical weapons in 1914 may have contributed to later German use of such weapons.",
            "Fritz Haber (] ; 9 December 1868 \u2013 29 January 1934) was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber\u2013Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is of importance for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing nitrogen fertilizers. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born\u2013Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid."

            "The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, psychedelia, experimental music, modal jazz, country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\". \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\". The band was ranked 57th by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.",
            "Robert Hall Weir ( ; born October 16, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016 and 2017."

Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team retrogressed to 5\u20135, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers and Jets both finished 10\u20136, but the Steelers clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents.

            "Gordon \"Gordie\" Howe, OC (March 31, 1928 \u2013 June 10, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. From 1946 to 1980, he played twenty-six seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and six seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA); his first 25 seasons were spent with the Detroit Red Wings. Nicknamed \"Mr. Hockey\", Howe is considered the most complete player to ever play the game and one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time. A 23-time NHL All-Star, he held many of the sport's career scoring records until they were broken in the 1980s by Wayne Gretzky, who himself has been a major champion of Howe's legacy. He continues to hold NHL records for most games and seasons played. In 2017, Howe was named one of the \"100 Greatest NHL Players\".",
            "The Saskatoon Minor Football Field at Gordon Howe Park (formerly known as Gordie Howe Bowl) is a football stadium located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was opened September 30, 1960, built on land repossessed by the city in 1931 for unpaid taxes. It is the home of the Saskatoon Hilltops, who play in the Prairie Football Conference of the Canadian Junior Football League and is also used for high school football. It is located on the southwest corner of the city. The park is named after Gordie Howe, a Saskatoon native and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame."

The bloodwoods had been recognised as a distinct group within the large and diverse \"Eucalyptus\" genus since 1867. Molecular research in the 1990s, however, showed that they, along with the rest of the Corymbia section, are more closely related to \"Angophora\" than to \"Eucalyptus\", and are probably best regarded as a separate genus. All three genera\u2014\"Angophora\", \"Corymbia\" and \"Eucalyptus\"\u2014are closely related, often difficult to tell apart, and are still commonly and correctly referred to as \"eucalypts\". Groups of naturalists and conservationists do not recognise the \"Corymbia\" genus and still categorise its species within \"Eucalyptus\".",

            "Nymphaea is a genus of hardy and tender aquatic plants in the family Nymphaeaceae. The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants, and many cultivars have been bred. Some taxa occur as introduced species where they are not native, and some are weeds. Plants of the genus are known commonly as water lilies. The genus name is from the Greek \u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1, \"nymphaia\" and the Latin \"nymphaea\", which mean \"water lily\" and were inspired by the nymphs of Greek and Latin mythology.",

            "The history of Belgium predates the founding of the modern state of that name in 1830. Belgium's history is intertwined with those of its neighbours: the Netherlands, Germany, France and Luxembourg. For most of its history, what is now Belgium was either a part of a larger territory, such as the Carolingian Empire, or divided into a number of smaller states, prominent among them being the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and County of Luxembourg. Due to its strategic location and the many armies fighting on its soil, since the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Belgium has often been called the \"battlefield of Europe\" or the \"cockpit of Europe\". It is also remarkable as a European nation which contains, and is divided by, a language boundary between Latin-derived French and Germanic Dutch.",

            "The Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74, Path\u00e9tique is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's final completed symphony, written between February and the end of August 1893. The composer entitled the work \"The Passionate Symphony\", employing a Russian word, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f (\"Pateticheskaya\"), meaning \"passionate\" or \"emotional\", that was then mistranslated into French as \"path\u00e9tique\", \"evoking pity\", yet the mistranslation survived subsequent productions in every country but Russia. The composer led the first performance in Saint Petersburg on 16/28 October of that year, nine days before his death. The second performance, conducted by Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk, took place 21 days later, at a memorial concert on 6/18 November. It included some minor corrections that Tchaikovsky had made after the premiere, and was thus the first performance of the work in the exact form in which it is known today. The first performance in Moscow was on 4/16 December, conducted by Vasily Safonov. It was the last of Tchaikovsky's compositions premiered in his lifetime; his last composition of all, the single-movement 3rd Piano Concerto, Op. 75, which was completed in October 1893, a short time before his death, received a posthumous premiere.",

Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing full-powered rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles.

The company has presence in 40 countries and territories and sells products in more than 150 nations. The company operates through three business segments: North America, international, and American Girl. It is the world's largest toy maker in terms of revenue. On January 17, 2017, Mattel named Google executive Margo Georgiadis as its next CEO.",
            "Uno ( ; from Italian and Spanish for 'one') (stylized as UNO) is an American card game that is played with a specially printed deck (see Crazy Eights for a family of games very similar to Uno but played with normal playing cards). The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies."

He trained with the engraver Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly, which caught the attention of the Italian cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli, who invited him to engrave his own maps. In 1694 Nolin was named geographer to the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Philippe II), and in 1701 he was named engraver to the king (Louis XIV). Nolin set up a family publishing house on Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris, which was initially unsuccessful until it was moved nearer to other geographers on Quai de l'Horloge. Many of Nolin's maps were based on previous works by Coronelli and the amateur geographer Jean-Nicholas de Tralage, known as Sieur de Tillemon, who supplied him with most of his material."

Erected in 1916, when the Socialist movement was strong in the city, it was active for only a few years until socialism fell out of favor amidst persecution of socialists and labor unionists including the Anaconda Road Massacre and the lynching of Frank Little.",
            "Frank H. (Franklin Henry) Little (1878 \u2013 August 1, 1917) was an American labor leader who was lynched in Butte, Montana, for his union and anti-war activities. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, organizing miners, lumberjacks, and oil field workers. He was a member of the union's Executive Board when he was murdered."
