The team was composed of English thin man Stan Laurel (1890\u20131965) and American fat man Oliver Hardy (1892\u20131957). They became well known during the late 1920s through the mid-1940s for their slapstick comedy, with Laurel playing the clumsy and childlike friend of the pompous bully Hardy. The duo's signature tune is known variously as \"The Cuckoo Song\", \"Ku-Ku\", or \"The Dance of the Cuckoos\". It was played over the opening credits of their films and has become as emblematic of the duo as their bowler hats."

            "Martin Heidegger ( ; ] ; 26 September 188926 May 1976) was a German philosopher and a seminal thinker in the Continental tradition and philosophical hermeneutics. According to the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", he is \"widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century\". Heidegger is best known for his contributions to phenomenology and existentialism, though as the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" cautions, \"his thinking should be identified as part of such philosophical movements only with extreme care and qualification\".",
            "Loewald's father, who died shortly after his birth, was a Jewish physician with an interest in dermatology and psychiatry; his mother a gifted musician, who played the piano. Loewald did medical training in Germany - where he also studied philosophy with Martin Heidegger, who would influence him with his theory of language - before taking a medical degree from Rome University in 1935. He practised psychiatry in Italy until 1939, before moving with his family to the United States. There he became fascinated by Freud\u2019s theory, in which he rooted all the features of his own thinking. He did not want to create a new psychoanalytic terminology, but, although he used Freud\u2019s terms, he gave them radically new meanings."

Conway cited it as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States President Donald Trump. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky on charges including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al-Qaeda in Iraq\".

The chips are made of ground corn, vegetable oil, and seasoning. The full ingredients list is vegetable oils (sunflower, palmolein), milk solids (cheese powder), food acids (270, 330, 331), flavour enhancers (621, 627, 631), starch (wheat, maize), vegetable powders (onion, tomato, garlic), salt, sugar, herbs, spice (cumin), flavour (natural and nature identical), yeast extract, vegetable extract (soy, wheat), antioxidants (304, 306).",

            "Seth Edward Putnam (May 15, 1968 \u2013 June 11, 2011) was an American musician who was the founder of grindcore band Anal Cunt. He was known for his brutal screaming and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke morbid humor. Throughout his career, Putnam had been involved in many side projects, including backing vocals on Pantera's \"The Great Southern Trendkill.\"",
            "William Patrick \"Billy\" Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American musician, songwriter, producer, poet, and entrepreneur. He is best known as the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the band quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album (\"TheFutureEmbrace\") and a collection of poetry (\"Blinking with Fists\") before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins."

            "Jean de Florette (] ) is a 1986 French period drama film directed by Claude Berri, based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol. It is followed by \"Manon des Sources\". The film takes place in rural Provence, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. The film starred three of France's most prominent actors \u2013 G\u00e9rard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, who won a BAFTA award for his performance, and Yves Montand in one of his last roles before his death.",
            "Reassuringly Expensive was the Stella Artois' advertising slogan in the United Kingdom from 1982 until 2007. The 1990s UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotif taken from the score of \"Jean de Florette\", inspired, in turn, by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". The TV campaigns began in 1991 with a series of adverts based on \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres including war movies, silent comedy and even surrealism (for which the slogan was changed to \"Reassuringly Elephants\"). They have used notable movie directors such as Jonathan Glazer, and their aim was to portray the drink in a context of sophisticated European culture."

He studied law under future U.S. Senator John Holmes and was admitted to the York County, Maine Bar in 1817. Residing in Alfred, Maine, Goodenow served three one year terms in the Maine House of Representatives (1827, 1828 and 1830), which included a term as Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. He was a member of the National Republican Party while in the Legislature. In 1831, Goodenow was the Whig Party candidate for Governor. Unsuccessful, he ran again in 1832 and 1833. In 1838 and 1841, Goodenow served as Maine Attorney General."

            "Inspector Gadget is a 1999 American action-comedy film directed by David Kellogg, written by Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn from a story by Ehrin and Dana Olsen. It is loosely based on the 1983 animated cartoon series of the same name. It stars Matthew Broderick as the title character, along with Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw, Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny, and Dabney Coleman as Chief Quimby. Three new characters were introduced, Dr. Brenda Bradford (played by Joely Fisher), Mayor Wilson (played by Cheri Oteri) and the Gadgetmobile (voiced by D. L. Hughley). The film tells the story of how Inspector Gadget and Dr. Claw came to be in the cartoon.",

Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a \"bazooka\" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns."

            "The 1979 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season to include both male and female names, as well as the common six-year rotating lists of tropical cyclone names. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was slightly below average, with nine systems reaching tropical storm intensity. The first system, an unnumbered tropical depression, developed north of Puerto Rico on June 9. Two days later, Tropical Depression One formed and produced severe flooding in Jamaica, with 40 deaths and about $27 million (1979 USD) in damage. Tropical Storm Ana caused minimal impact in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Bob spawned tornadoes and produced minor wind damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States, primarily in Louisiana, while the remnants caused flooding, especially in Indiana. Tropical Storm Claudette caused extensive flooding, due to torrential rainfall. There were two deaths and damaged totaled $750 million.",
            "Tropical Storm Claudette caused significant flooding in eastern Texas and western Louisiana in July 1979. The third named storm of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, Claudette developed from a tropical wave located east of the Windward Islands on July 16. It gradually strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. As it neared landfall in Puerto Rico early on July 18, upper-level winds weakened it back to a tropical depression. Claudette remained disorganized and the National Hurricane Center operationally reported that it degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. Late on July 18, the depression struck Dominican Republic, emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. Claudette struck western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and \"regenerating\" into a tropical cyclone. By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border late on July 23 as a moderately strong tropical storm. It weakened slowly and drifted over land, lasting until dissipation in West Virginia on July 29."

He is best remembered for briefly being the Democratic vice presidential nominee under George McGovern in 1972. He suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life, resulting in several hospitalizations, which were kept secret from the public. When they were revealed it humiliated the McGovern campaign and Eagleton was forced to quit the race. He later became adjunct professor of public affairs at Washington University in St. Louis.",

He and Clark Hoyt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for uncovering the fact that Senator Thomas Eagleton, George McGovern's choice for vice president, had had severe psychiatric problems and undergone three shock treatments. Instead of publishing their scoop, they disclosed their findings to McGovern's top advisor, and Eagleton withdrew as the Democratic nominee."

            "Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 \u2013 February 16, 1998) was an American toxicologist and public health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying the effects of the 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her being threatened, to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards the end of her life she received numerous awards and accolades.",

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries still extant at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War only twenty-one years later.",

Adapted from the 2004 novel of the same name by David Mitchell, the film has multiple plots set across six different eras, which Mitchell described as \"a sort of pointillist mosaic.\" The official synopsis describes it as \"an exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.\" Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Jim Broadbent lead an ensemble cast."

The park was created for the purpose of preserving, protecting, and interpreting the industrial heritage of the Blackstone River Valley and the urban, rural, and agricultural landscape of that region. The Blackstone River Valley was the site of some of the earliest successful textile mills in the United States, and these mills contributed significantly to the earliest American Industrial Revolution. The subsequent construction of the Blackstone Canal, a few years after the successful completion of the Erie Canal, helped to sustain the region's industrial strength.",
            "The Erie Canal is a canal in New York that is part of the east\u2013west, cross-state route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal). Originally, it ran 363 mi from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie. It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States."

Fianna members were involved in the setting up of the armed nationalist body the Irish Volunteers, and had their own circle of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). They took part in the 1914 Howth gun-running and (as Volunteer members) in the 1916 Easter Rising. They were active in the War of Independence and took the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War.",

A founder member of Fianna \u00c9ireann, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, she took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, when Irish republicans attempted to end British rule and establish an Irish Republic. She was sentenced to death but this was reduced on the grounds of her gender. In December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons, though she did not take her seat and, along with the other Sinn F\u00e9in TDs, formed the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. She was also the second woman in the world to hold a cabinet position (Minister for Labour of the Irish Republic, 1919\u20131922)."

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Faruq. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment."

As of 2010, Nikki Hurst replaced Ford as lead vocalist when Ford expressed interest in taking a break to go to school. The new line up however remained the same and Ford decided to work on other musical projects minus the Kirkham brothers. The name is derived from the motorcycle of the same name, the Vincent Black Shadow. \"Fears in the Water\" was first released on July 11, 2006, and their sophomore effort, \"El Monstruo\", on September 15, 2008.

            "Turpinite, also called Turpenite, is a fictional war gas allegedly developed by the French chemist Eug\u00e8ne Turpin and deployed against the attacking German army during the first months of World War I. According to contemporary accounts, Turpinite, delivered by artillery shells, silently and suddenly killed any person within 400 yd of impact with its fumes. Survivors of Turpinite barrages reported a strong chemical smell after an attack. In reality, this smell was a side effect of the explosives used by the French and British militaries during the war. The widespread, sudden deaths caused by artillery were in many cases caused by concussion, which leaves no mark on the victim. After the war, German scientist Fritz Haber, who pioneered German gas attacks at the Second Battle of Ypres, said German soldiers had reported a strong chemical smell attributed to turpenite. Haber and others investigated, finding the smell was due to incomplete combustion of the picric acid used in British artillery shells. The belief that the French used chemical weapons in 1914 may have contributed to later German use of such weapons.",
            "Fritz Haber (] ; 9 December 1868 \u2013 29 January 1934) was a German chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber\u2013Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is of importance for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. The food production for half the world's current population depends on this method for producing nitrogen fertilizers. Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born\u2013Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid."

The presidential oath was administered by Chief Justice John Marshall. Gerry died into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. (Prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency.)",

As a Democratic-Republican he served as the fifth Vice President of the United States from March 1813 until his death in November 1814.

            "The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, psychedelia, experimental music, modal jazz, country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\". \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\". The band was ranked 57th by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.",
            "Robert Hall Weir ( ; born October 16, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016 and 2017."

Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team retrogressed to 5\u20135, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers and Jets both finished 10\u20136, but the Steelers clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. The Jets finished the season as the league's only team with a winning record to not make the playoffs.",

Nicknamed \"Mr. Hockey\", Howe is considered the most complete player to ever play the game and one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time. A 23-time NHL All-Star, he held many of the sport's career scoring records until they were broken in the 1980s by Wayne Gretzky, who himself has been a major champion of Howe's legacy. He continues to hold NHL records for most games and seasons played. In 2017, Howe was named one of the \"100 Greatest NHL Players\".",

            "Corymbia is a genus of about 113 species of tree that were classified as \"Eucalyptus\" species until the mid-1990s. It includes the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums. The bloodwoods had been recognised as a distinct group within the large and diverse \"Eucalyptus\" genus since 1867. Molecular research in the 1990s, however, showed that they, along with the rest of the Corymbia section, are more closely related to \"Angophora\" than to \"Eucalyptus\", and are probably best regarded as a separate genus. All three genera\u2014\"Angophora\", \"Corymbia\" and \"Eucalyptus\"\u2014are closely related, often difficult to tell apart, and are still commonly and correctly referred to as \"eucalypts\". Groups of naturalists and conservationists do not recognise the \"Corymbia\" genus and still categorise its species within \"Eucalyptus\".",

            "The history of Belgium predates the founding of the modern state of that name in 1830. Belgium's history is intertwined with those of its neighbours: the Netherlands, Germany, France and Luxembourg. For most of its history, what is now Belgium was either a part of a larger territory, such as the Carolingian Empire, or divided into a number of smaller states, prominent among them being the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge and County of Luxembourg. Due to its strategic location and the many armies fighting on its soil, since the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), Belgium has often been called the \"battlefield of Europe\" or the \"cockpit of Europe\". It is also remarkable as a European nation which contains, and is divided by, a language boundary between Latin-derived French and Germanic Dutch.",

            "The Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74, Path\u00e9tique is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's final completed symphony, written between February and the end of August 1893. The composer entitled the work \"The Passionate Symphony\", employing a Russian word, \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f (\"Pateticheskaya\"), meaning \"passionate\" or \"emotional\", that was then mistranslated into French as \"path\u00e9tique\", \"evoking pity\", yet the mistranslation survived subsequent productions in every country but Russia. The composer led the first performance in Saint Petersburg on 16/28 October of that year, nine days before his death. The second performance, conducted by Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk, took place 21 days later, at a memorial concert on 6/18 November. It included some minor corrections that Tchaikovsky had made after the premiere, and was thus the first performance of the work in the exact form in which it is known today. The first performance in Moscow was on 4/16 December, conducted by Vasily Safonov. It was the last of Tchaikovsky's compositions premiered in his lifetime; his last composition of all, the single-movement 3rd Piano Concerto, Op. 75, which was completed in October 1893, a short time before his death, received a posthumous premiere.",

            "The Palais Garnier (] French    ) is a 1,979-seat opera house, which was built from 1861 to 1875 for the Paris Opera. It was called the Salle des Capucines, because of its location on the Boulevard des Capucines in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, but soon became known as the Palais Garnier, in recognition of its opulence and its architect, Charles Garnier. The theatre is also often referred to as the Op\u00e9ra Garnier (French    ) and historically was known as the Op\u00e9ra de Paris or simply the Op\u00e9ra, as it was the primary home of the Paris Opera and its associated Paris Opera Ballet until 1989, when the Op\u00e9ra Bastille opened at the Place de la Bastille. The Paris Opera now mainly uses the Palais Garnier for ballet."

Though Western nations were slow to accept the assault rifle concept, by the end of the 20th century they had become the standard weapon in most of the world's armies, replacing full-powered rifles and sub-machine guns in most roles. Examples include the StG 44, AK-47 and the M16 rifle.",

            "Uno ( ; from Italian and Spanish for 'one') (stylized as UNO) is an American card game that is played with a specially printed deck (see Crazy Eights for a family of games very similar to Uno but played with normal playing cards). The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies."

He trained with the engraver Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly, which caught the attention of the Italian cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli, who invited him to engrave his own maps. In 1694 Nolin was named geographer to the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Philippe II), and in 1701 he was named engraver to the king (Louis XIV). Nolin set up a family publishing house on Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris, which was initially unsuccessful until it was moved nearer to other geographers on Quai de l'Horloge. Many of Nolin's maps were based on previous works by Coronelli and the amateur geographer Jean-Nicholas de Tralage, known as Sieur de Tillemon, who supplied him with most of his material."

She gained her biggest success in the late 1970s and 1980s and has been nominated twice for Brit Awards.

She is generally referred to as the \"British Queen of Blues\". By April 2012, Brooks had released more albums that had reached the top 75 of the UK album chart than any other British female artist, although this has since been equaled by Kate Bush.",

It also consists of guitarist Drew Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, and drummer Eddie Fisher. The band first achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2003, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, but the band ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album ever came out. The lead single of that album, \"Apologize\", was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts."

Corral on October 26, 1881. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. The lawmen killed Cowboys Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Billy's older brother, Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight.

            "Elves, a word from Germanic mythology, are frequently featured in Fantasy fiction. In modern fiction, particularly because of the influence from J. R. R.

Along with this development, Dark elves are often modeled as a more sinister counterpart to the High elves, like the Drow or the Trow, which are the fairy-like dark creatures of Orcadian and Shetlandic folklore. The dark elves (\"D\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar\") or black elves (\"Svart\u00e1lfar\") are presented in Germanic mythology as dwarves and gray ones."

The show originally aired on the AMC network for five seasons, from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013. It tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Together with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), White turns to a life of crime by producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal world. The title comes from the Southern colloquialism \"breaking bad\", meaning to \"raise hell\" or turn toward crime. \"Breaking Bad\" is set and was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
            "Dr. Donna J. Nelson is Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma. Nelson specializes in organic chemistry, which she both researches and teaches. Nelson's career has focused on five primary topics of research generally categorized in two areas, \"Scientific Research\" and \"America's Scientific Readiness\". Within Scientific Research, Nelson's topics have been on mechanistic patterns in alkene addition reactions and on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT) functionalization and analysis, yielding the first COSY NMR spectrum of covalently functionalized SWCNTs in solution. Under America's Scientific Readiness, she focuses on science education, which includes classroom innovations and correcting organic chemistry textbook inaccuracies, on ethnic and gender diversity (the Nelson Diversity Surveys) among highly ranked science departments of research universities, and on improving the image and presentation of science and scientists to the public. Nelson also served as a science advisor to the AMC television show \"Breaking Bad.\" She was the 2016 President of the American Chemical Society (ACS)."

            "Red Mountain is a long ridge running southwest-northeast and dividing Jones Valley from Shades Valley south of Birmingham, Alabama. It is part of the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian mountains. The Red Mountain Formation of hard Silurian rock strata lies exposed in several long crests, and was named \"Red Mountain\" because of the rust-stained rock faces and prominent seams of red hematite iron ore. The mountain was the site of the Sloss Mines, which supplied ore to Birmingham's iron furnaces. The best displays of the mountain's geological strata occur at the Twentieth Street cut near the Vulcan statue and at the U.S. Route 31 highway cut leading into the suburb of Homewood. Most of Birmingham's television and radio stations have their transmission towers located on Red Mountain. Red Mountain is also home to the newly created Red Mountain Park, one of the nation's largest urban parks at 1500 acre , making it larger than even New York City's Central Park.",

The group consists of founders Dave Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Andy Fletcher (keyboards, bass guitar). Depeche Mode released their debut album \"Speak & Spell\" in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Original band member Vince Clarke (keyboards, guitar), left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record \"A Broken Frame\", released the following year. Gore took over the lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, bass guitar) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next 13 years. Depeche Mode have been a trio again since 1995, when Wilder left."

(This is the same source as Gaetano Rossi had used for his libretto for Mercadante's \"Il giuramento\" in 1837).",
            "Daphne, Op.82, is an opera in one act by Richard Strauss, subtitled \"Bucolic Tragedy in One Act\". The German libretto was by Joseph Gregor. The opera is based loosely on the mythological figure Daphne from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and includes elements taken from \"The Bacchae\" by Euripides. The opera premiered at the Semperoper in Dresden on 15 October 1938, originally intended as a double bill with Strauss' \"Friedenstag\", but as the scale of \"Daphne\" grew, that idea was abandoned. The conductor of the first performance was Karl B\u00f6hm, to whom the opera was dedicated."

            "Animals is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. It is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late-1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. \"Animals\" was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that three years later would culminate in keyboardist Richard Wright leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis.",

            "Mysterium Paschale. The Mystery of Easter (German: \"Theologie der Drei Tage\" ) is a 1970 book by the Swiss theologian and Catholic priest Hans Urs von Balthasar. It offers an account of the death and resurrection of Christ, and their significance for the Christian life. Balthasar discusses the \"bodiliness\" of the Resurrection from the \"radical\" death of Jesus, involving his descent into the place of the dead on Holy Saturday. Balthasar's willingness to assume the nature and the consequence of his sin makes him, as well as the reader, extrapolate that God can endure and conquer godlessness, abandonment, and death. In the \"Preface to the Second Edition\", Balthasar takes a cue from Revelation (Vulgate: \"agni qui occisus est ab origine mundi\", NIV: \"the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world\") to explore the idea that, from the \"immanent Trinity\" up to the \"economic\" One, \"God is love\" consists in an \"eternal super-kenosis\".",

            "The Stone Gods is a 2007 novel by Jeanette Winterson. It is mainly a post apocalyptic love story concerned with corporate control of government, the harshness of war, and the dehumanization that technology brings, among other themes. The novel is self-referential, where later characters in the story find and read earlier sections of the book itself, and where certain sets of characters\u2019 story arcs repeat, particularly those of a Robo 'Sapien' named Spike and her reluctant human companion, Billie. This technique sets the book in the postmodernist genre, though it is mainly used to warn against history\u2019s tendency to repeat itself, as well as humanity\u2019s inability to learn from past mistakes, even when these mistakes repeat across history, planets, and their respective evolutionary timelines.",

Some of her other novels have explored gender polarities and sexual identity. Winterson is also a broadcaster and a professor of creative writing. She is a two-time winner of the Lambda Literary Award, which focuses on LGBT issues."

The film stars an ensemble cast led by Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman, Will Ferrell, Gary Beach, Roger Bart, and Jon Lovitz. Creature effects were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.",
            "The Producers is a musical adapted by Mel Brooks and Thomas Meehan from Brooks's 1967 film of the same name, with lyrics written by Brooks and music composed by Brooks and arranged by Glen Kelly and Doug Besterman. As in the film, the story concerns two theatrical producers who scheme to get rich by overselling interests in a Broadway flop. Complications arise when the show unexpectedly turns out to be successful. The humor of the show draws on ridiculous accents, caricatures of homosexuals and Nazis, and many show business in-jokes."

The film is named after the weapons \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\" that were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. The code names, originally Fat Man and Thin Man, were drawn from characters in the works of Dashiell Hammett. However, there's a possible secondary allusion to stout project director Gen. Leslie Groves and the slim scientific director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film focuses much attention on the frequently strained relationship between the two men."

The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at 58 sqmi . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority.",

DeSalvio (May 29, 1910 \u2013 August 17, 2004) served in the New York State Assembly for over 38 continuous years, longer than all but one other member in the history of that body. From 1941 to 1979, he represented districts that included the southern end of Manhattan (including the Lower East Side), Liberty Island, Ellis Island, Governors Island, and (after 1972) the eastern edge of Staten Island. From 1975 to 1978, he served as the Assembly\u2019s speaker pro tempore. In that capacity, he often presided over the body."

            "Per Mertesacker (] ; born 29 September 1984) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre back for Premier League club Arsenal. He also played for the Germany national team but retired in August 2014 after winning the World Cup. Mertesacker is a youth product of Hannover 96 and he made his senior league debut in November 2003. He was soon dubbed \"the Defence Pole\" (\"\"die Abwehrlatte\"\") by German tabloids and gained a reputation for his good disciplinary record, going 31 Bundesliga games without being booked. Since joining Arsenal, their fans have nicknamed him \"the BFG\", which is short for \"Big Fucking German\" and an allusion to Roald Dahl's \"The BFG\" due to his height. He has been described as an imposing, reliable, dominant and an accomplished defender.",
            "The 2015 FA Cup Final was the 134th final of the FA Cup, the world's oldest football cup competition. The match was contested by Arsenal and Aston Villa at Wembley Stadium in London. The match was played on 30 May 2015 and was the final match of the competition. Arsenal won the match 4\u20130 with goals from Theo Walcott, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Per Mertesacker and Olivier Giroud, for a record 12th title. This was the sixth FA Cup win for manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, putting him in joint-first place for wins with George Ramsay."

            "Paul Albert Anka {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (born July 30, 1941) is a Canadian-American singer, songwriter, and actor. Anka became famous during the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s with hit songs like \"Diana\", \"Lonely Boy\", \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\", and \"(You're) Having My Baby\". He wrote such well-known music as the theme for \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and one of Tom Jones's biggest hits, \"She's a Lady\", as well as the English lyrics on Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux's music, for Frank Sinatra's signature song, \"My Way\", which has been covered by many including Elvis Presley. He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in 2005.",
            "\"This Is It\" is a song co-written by American pop star and musician Michael Jackson and Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka. The song was recorded by the former and featured as a track on the album, \"This Is It\" (2009), which accompanies the 2009 concert documentary \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\". It was premiered worldwide on Jackson's official website on October 12, 2009 four months after his death on June 25, 2009. Although Sony Music Entertainment referred to the song as a \"new single\" during its promotion, it was later confirmed that the song would only be sent for airplay, and not be available to buy as a single release. According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's \"Walk a Fine Line\" album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through. Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, \"I Wasn't Born Yesterday\" (1991). The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 \"Duets\" album. While putting together the \"This Is It\" album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found. His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording. Immediately after its release, Anka threatened legal action against Jackson's estate. The estate then agreed to give Anka 50% of the song's publishing rights."

            "Blink-182 (often stylized as blink-182; pronounced \"blink one eighty two\") is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Since 2015, the lineup of the band has consisted of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Founded by guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, Hoppus and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; in response, the band appended the meaningless number \"-182\".",
            "Veridia, often stylized in all capital letters as VERIDIA, is an American Christian alternative rock band from Nashville, Tennessee. Formed in 2013, the group now consists of Deena Jakoub (vocals), Brandon Brown (guitar), and Kyle Levy (drums)."

            "John Wheelwright (c.1592\u20131679), was a Puritan clergyman in England and America, and was most noted for being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Antinomian Controversy, and for subsequently establishing the town of Exeter, New Hampshire. Born in Lincolnshire, England, he was raised in a family with substantial means, and received both a B.A. and M.A. at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge where he was a noted athlete and where Oliver Cromwell was a college friend. Ordained in 1619, he became the vicar of the church in Bilsby, Lincolnshire, and held this position for ten years until removed for simony.",
            "William Wentworth (1616\u20131697) was a follower of John Wheelwright, and an early settler of New Hampshire. Coming from Alford in Lincolnshire, he likely came to New England with Wheelwright in 1636, but no records are found of him in Boston. When Wheelwright was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his role in the Antinomian Controversy, he established the settlement of Exeter, New Hampshire, and Wentworth followed him there and then to Wells, Maine. After Wheelwright left Wells for Hampton, New Hampshire, Wentworth went to Dover, New Hampshire, and this is where he lived the remainder of his life. He was the proprietor of a sawmill, and held several town offices, but is most noted for being an elder in his Dover church for nearly 40 years. He had 11 children with two wives, and has numerous descendants, including many of great prominence."

Gold was first discovered in the Nickel Plate Mountain area in 1897 and several small mines were developed over the years. The Hedley Mascot Mine operated between 1936 and 1949 and was one of the most unusual mining operations in the world, being built entirely on the side of a mountain, 5,000 feet above the town of Hedley or seven thousand feet above sea level. In the 1990s, the British Columbia government was going to burn the site down because it posed a safety risk, but the Minister of Tourism at the time intervened and, in 1995, steps were taken to preserve the site as a Provincial Heritage resource."

            "Aaron Tyler (born May 22, 1967), better known by his stage name MC Eiht, is an American rapper born in Augusta, Georgia. Many of his songs are based on his life in Compton. His stage name was partly inspired by the numeral in KRS-One's name. He chose Eiht for its links to \"hood culture\", including Olde English 800 (8 Ball) and .38 caliber firearms. He is the \"de facto\" leader of West Coast hip hop group Compton's Most Wanted, which also included fellow Compton-based rappers Boom Bam, Tha Chill, DJ Mike T, DJ Slip and Ant Capone. He is also known for his role as A-Wax in the 1993 film \"Menace II Society\".",

            "Making North America is a 2015 American documentary film which premiered nationwide on November 4, 2015. The PBS Nova film, in three-episodes of one hour each, was hosted by Kirk Johnson (Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History); Peter Oxley directed the first episode while Gwyn Williams directed the second and third. The series describes the very beginnings and later developments of the North American continent: from the origin of planet Earth 4.54 billion years ago; to the various movements of tectonic plates and their effect on the sculpturing of the continent's land and mountains, including the Rocky Mountains, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon; to the emergence of life on the continent and its later evolution; and, finally, to the more recent settlement of the land by humans. According to Johnson, \"Most people will not have considered a time when there was no North America ... What was there before North America? How did it form? When did it start? How did it come together?\"",
            "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon is a 2001 film written, produced and directed by Nashville-based filmmaker Bart Sibrel. Sibrel is a critic of the Apollo program and proponent of the conspiracy theory that the six Apollo Moon landing missions between 1969 and 1972 were elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by the United States government, including NASA."

The music was composed by Wong Fuk Ling (\u738b\u798f\u9f61), and the lyrics were written by Tao Tseon (\u9676\u79e6). The song was first sung by Koo Mei (\u9867\u5a9a), sister of Joseph Koo, in the 1961 Shaw Brothers film of the same name (\u4e0d\u4e86\u60c5). This song has been sung by various singers in later years, such as Sally Yeh, Anita Mui, Tsai Chin and Francis Yip."
