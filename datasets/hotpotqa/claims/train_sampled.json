Featuring a solid-propellant rocket for propulsion, it allowed for high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The universally-applied nickname arose from the M1 variant's vague resemblance to the musical instrument called a \"bazooka\" invented and popularized by 1930s U.S. comedian Bob Burns."

According to contemporary accounts, Turpinite, delivered by artillery shells, silently and suddenly killed any person within 400 yd of impact with its fumes. Survivors of Turpinite barrages reported a strong chemical smell after an attack. In reality, this smell was a side effect of the explosives used by the French and British militaries during the war. The widespread, sudden deaths caused by artillery were in many cases caused by concussion, which leaves no mark on the victim. After the war, German scientist Fritz Haber, who pioneered German gas attacks at the Second Battle of Ypres, said German soldiers had reported a strong chemical smell attributed to turpenite. Haber and others investigated, finding the smell was due to incomplete combustion of the picric acid used in British artillery shells. The belief that the French used chemical weapons in 1914 may have contributed to later German use of such weapons.",

Balthasar discusses the \"bodiliness\" of the Resurrection from the \"radical\" death of Jesus, involving his descent into the place of the dead on Holy Saturday. Balthasar's willingness to assume the nature and the consequence of his sin makes him, as well as the reader, extrapolate that God can endure and conquer godlessness, abandonment, and death. In the \"Preface to the Second Edition\", Balthasar takes a cue from Revelation (Vulgate: \"agni qui occisus est ab origine mundi\", NIV: \"the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world\") to explore the idea that, from the \"immanent Trinity\" up to the \"economic\" One, \"God is love\" consists in an \"eternal super-kenosis\".",

            "Fat Man and Little Boy (a.k.a. Shadow Makers in the UK) is a 1989 film that reenacts the Manhattan Project, the secret Allied endeavor to develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. The film is named after the weapons \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man\" that were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. The code names, originally Fat Man and Thin Man, were drawn from characters in the works of Dashiell Hammett. However, there's a possible secondary allusion to stout project director Gen. Leslie Groves and the slim scientific director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film focuses much attention on the frequently strained relationship between the two men."

Although Sony Music Entertainment referred to the song as a \"new single\" during its promotion, it was later confirmed that the song would only be sent for airplay, and not be available to buy as a single release. According to Anka, the song was recorded in 1983 and intended to be a duet between him and Jackson on Anka's \"Walk a Fine Line\" album under the title \"I Never Heard\", but these plans fell through. Thereafter, Sa-Fire recorded the track for her album, \"I Wasn't Born Yesterday\" (1991). The duet version of the song was featured in Anka's 2013 \"Duets\" album. While putting together the \"This Is It\" album, Jackson's demo version of the song was found. His brothers' vocals and additional instrumentation were then added to the recording.

Members of the breed may also be referred to as a Chessie, CBR, or Chesapeake. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt. It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake have a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.",
            "The Newfoundland dog is a large working dog. They can be either black, brown, or white-and-black (called Landseer). However, in Canada, the country of their origin, the only correct colours are either black or Landseer. They were originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in the Dominion of Newfoundland (which is now part of Canada). They are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm dispositions, and loyalty. Newfoundland dogs excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed feet, and innate swimming abilities."
